Hydraulic fracturing, sometimes called \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfracing\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfracking,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is the process of injecting fracturing fluid, which is typically a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals, into the subsurface to fracture the subsurface geological formations and release otherwise encapsulated hydrocarbon reserves. The fracturing fluid is typically pumped into a wellbore at a relatively high pressure sufficient to cause fissures within the underground geological formations. Specifically, once inside the wellbore, the pressurized fracturing fluid is pressure pumped down and then out into the subsurface geological formation to fracture the underground formation. A fluid mixture that may include water, various chemical additives, and proppants (e.g., sand or ceramic materials) can be pumped into the underground formation to fracture and promote the extraction of the hydrocarbon reserves, such as oil and/or gas. For example, the fracturing fluid may comprise a liquid petroleum gas, linear gelled water, gelled water, gelled oil, slick water, slick oil, poly emulsion, foam/emulsion, liquid carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, and/or binary fluid and acid.\\nImplementing large-scale fracturing operations at well sites typically require extensive investment in equipment, labor, and fuel. For instance, a typical fracturing operation uses a variety of fracturing equipment, numerous personnel to operate and maintain the fracturing equipment, large amounts of fuel to power the fracturing operations, and large volumes of fracturing fluids. As such, planning for fracturing operations is often complex and encompasses a variety of logistical challenges that include minimizing the on-site area or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfootprint\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d of the fracturing operations, providing adequate power and/or fuel to continuously power the fracturing operations, increasing the efficiency of the hydraulic fracturing equipment, and reducing any environmental impact resulting from fracturing operations. Thus, numerous innovations and improvements of existing fracturing technology are needed to address the variety of complex and logistical challenges faced in today's fracturing operations.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe following presents a simplified summary of the disclosed subject matter in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein.

The mobile source of electricity may be implemented using a single transport (e.g., single trailer or truck) to reduce its \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfootprint\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d at a site. The transport (e.g., power generation transport, gas turbine generator transport, and the like) may comprise a gas turbine and generator along with other equipment to supply electric power for different applications requiring a mobile source of electricity (e.g., at well sites). For example, the power generation transport may comprise a gas conditioning unit, black start generator, gas turbine air inlet filter housing, inlet plenum, gas turbine, exhaust collector, exhaust implement including an exhaust stack and an exhaust stack extension, gearbox, generator, breaker, transformer, control room, control system, elevating system, and additional ancillary equipment to produce electric power, while also reducing footprint of the power generation system by providing required power generation components on a single power generation transport.\\nThe power generation transport may be configured to be \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098self-sufficient\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 such that it can be quickly mobilized and de-mobilized without requiring use of external mechanical means or apparatus. For example, after reaching a remote site where a mobile source of electricity is required, the power generation transport can be quickly converted from a transportation mode to an operational mode by utilizing the elevating system mounted on the power generation transport. The elevating system converts the power generation transport from the transportation mode to the operational mode (without utilizing any external mechanical apparatus) by elevating the exhaust collector and the exhaust stack of the exhaust implement mounted on the power generation transport to an elevated standing position (e.g., upright position), and coupling the exhaust collector in the elevated standing position with the gas turbine mounted on the power generation transport. Alternately, the elevating system may convert the power generation transport to the operational mode by elevating an exhaust stack extension of the exhaust implement to an elevated standing position. In this case, the exhaust stack extension may be mounted to the exhaust stack, and the exhaust stack and the exhaust collector may be fixedly mounted to the base frame of the power generation transport and communicatively coupled to the exhaust port of the gas turbine to release the exhaust.\\nThe gas turbine of the power generation transport may then be operated to generate electricity. After the mobile source of electricity is no longer required at the remote site, the power generation transport can be mobilized to be in the transportation mode by the elevating system by lowering the exhaust stack (or exhaust stack extension) vertically downward to house at least a portion of the exhaust stack within the enclosure of the power generation transport, without use of any external mechanical apparatus.\\nIn the operational mode, the power generation transport may produce electric power in the range of about 1-15 megawatt (MW) (e.g., 5.6 MW). In one embodiment, the power generation transport may be configured such that the inlet (e.g., intake, intake port) of the gas turbine is connected to the air inlet filter housing of an air filter system mounted on the power generation transport, and the exhaust (e.g., outlet, exhaust port) of the gas turbine is detachably connected (e.g., fluidly coupled, aligned, or communicated) to the exhaust stack of the air filter system of the power generation transport.\\nThe mobile source of electricity may have different applications. For example, (one or more instances of) the mobile source of electricity may power mobile electric fracturing operations for one or more well sites by providing electric power to a variety of fracturing equipment located at the well sites. The different fracturing equipment, which include, but are not limited to, a blender, hydration unit, fracturing pump transport, sand handling equipment, chemical additive system, and the mobile source of electricity (e.g., power generation transport), may be configured to operate remotely via a control network system that monitors and controls the fracturing equipment using a network topology, such as an Ethernet ring topology network. The control network system may remove the need for implementing control stations located on and/or in close proximity to the fracturing equipment. Instead, a designated location, such as a data van and/or a remote location away from the vicinity of the fracturing equipment may remotely control the hydraulic fracturing equipment.\\nIn other embodiments, the power generation transport may be implemented to provide electric power for other applications (e.g., industrial, mining, commercial, civilian, agricultural, manufacturing, and the like) where mobile electric power is needed and where the requisite hydrocarbon fuel required to power the power generation transport is available. Although FIG. 1 illustrates the power generation transport being implanted to provide mobile electric power for a hydraulic fracturing application, this may not necessarily be the case. That is, the power generation transport may also be implemented for other oil-and-gas-related, or non-oil-and-gas-related applications where there is a need for a mobile source of electric power.\\n FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of well site 100 that comprises wellhead 101 and mobile fracturing system 103. Generally, mobile fracturing system 103 may perform fracturing operations to complete a well and/or transform a drilled well into a production well. For example, well site 100 may be a site where operators are in the process of drilling and completing a well. Operators may start the well completion process with drilling, running production casing, and cementing within the wellbore. The operators may also insert a variety of downhole tools into the wellbore and/or as part of a tool string used to drill the wellbore. After the operators drill the well to a certain depth, a horizontal portion of the well may also be drilled and subsequently encased in cement. The operators may subsequently remove the rig, and mobile fracturing system 103 may be moved onto well site 100 to perform fracturing operations that force relatively high pressure fracturing fluid through wellhead 101 into subsurface geological formations to create fissures and cracks within the rock. Fracturing system 103 may be moved off well site 100 once the operators complete fracturing operations. Typically, fracturing operations for well site 100 may last several days.\\nTo provide an environmentally cleaner and more transportable fracturing fleet, mobile fracturing system 103 may comprise mobile source of electricity 102 configured to power mobile fracturing system 103 or certain components of system 103 by generating electricity by converting hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas, obtained from one or more other sources (e.g., a producing wellhead) at well site 100, from a remote offsite location, and/or another relatively convenient location near mobile source of electricity 102. Improving mobility of mobile fracturing system 103 may be beneficial because fracturing operations at a well site typically last for several days and the fracturing equipment is subsequently removed from the well site after completing fracturing operation and moved to another remote location. Further, rather than using fuel that significantly impacts air quality (e.g., diesel fuel) as a source of power and/or receiving electric power from a grid or other type of stationary power generation facility (e.g., located at the well site or offsite), mobile fracturing system 103 utilizes mobile source of electricity 102 as a power source that burns cleaner while being transportable along with other fracturing equipment. The generated electricity from mobile source of electricity 102 may be supplied to fracturing equipment of system 103 to power fracturing operations at one or more well sites, or to other equipment in various types of applications requiring mobile electric power generation. As shown in FIG. 1, mobile source of electricity 102 may be implemented as a single power generation transport or trailer in order to reduce the well site footprint and provide the ability for operators to easily move mobile source of electricity 102 to different well sites and/or different fracturing jobs and/or different physical locations where a mobile source of power is needed.\\nConfiguration of mobile source of electricity 102 is described in more detail in FIGS. 2A-4. Mobile source of electricity 102 is not limited for use in a fracturing operation and may be applicable to power other types of equipment and devices not typically used in a fracturing operation. The use and discussion of FIG. 1 is only an example to facilitate ease of description and explanation of mobile source of electricity 102.\\nIn addition to mobile source of electricity 102, mobile fracturing system 103 may include switch gear transport 112, at least one blender transport 110, at least one data van 114, and one or more fracturing pump transports 108 that deliver fracturing fluid through wellhead 101 to subsurface geological formations. Switch gear transport 112 may receive electricity generated from mobile source of electric power 102 via one or more electrical connections. In one embodiment, switch gear transport 112 may use 13.8 kilovolts (kV) electrical connections to receive power from mobile source of electricity 102. Switch gear transport 112 may comprise a plurality of electrical disconnect switches, fuses, transformers, and/or circuit protectors to protect the fracturing equipment. The switch gear transport 112 may transfer the electricity received from the mobile source of electricity 102 to the electrically connected fracturing equipment of mobile fracturing system 103. Switch gear transport 112 may further comprise a control system to control, monitor, and provide power to the electrically connected fracturing equipment.\\nIn one embodiment, switch gear transport 112 may receive a 13.8 kV electrical connection and step down the voltage to 4.8 kV, which is provided to other fracturing equipment, such as fracturing pump transport 108, blender transport 110, sand storage and conveyor, hydration equipment, chemical equipment, data van 114, lighting equipment, and any additional auxiliary equipment used for the fracturing operations. Switch gear transport 112 may step down the voltage to 4.8 kV rather than other voltage levels, such as 600 V, in order to reduce cable size for the electrical connections and the amount of cabling used to connect mobile fracturing system 103. The control system may be configured to connect to a control network system such that switch gear transport 112 may be monitored and/or controlled from a distant location, such as data van 114 or some other type of control center. Alternately, switch gear transport 112 may simply pass through the higher voltage (e.g., 13.8 kV) to downstream equipment (e.g., frac pump transport 108), and the downstream equipment may include one or more transformers to perform any voltage step down operations (e.g., convert 13.8 kV voltage to lower voltage levels like 4.8 kV, 600 V, and the like) to power downstream frac equipment. The amount of cabling between switch gear transport 112 and downstream equipment can be reduced by performing the voltage step down operation further downstream.\\nFracturing pump transport 108 may receive the electric power from switch gear transport 112 to power a prime mover. The prime mover converts electric power to mechanical power for driving one or more pumps. In one embodiment, the prime mover may be a dual shaft electric motor that drives two different pumps. Fracturing pump transport 108 may be arranged such that one pump is coupled to opposite ends of the dual shaft electric motor and avoids coupling the pumps in series. By avoiding coupling the pump in series, fracturing pump transport 108 may continue to operate when either one of the pumps fails or have been removed from fracturing pump transport 108. Additionally, repairs to the pumps may be performed without disconnecting the system manifolds that connect fracturing pump transport 108 to other fracturing equipment within mobile fracturing system 103 and wellhead 101.\\n Blender transport 110 may receive electric power fed through switch gear transport 112 to power a plurality of electric blenders. A plurality of prime movers may drive one or more pumps that pump source fluid and blender additives (e.g., sand) into a blending tub, mix the source fluid and blender additives together to form fracturing fluid, and discharge the fracturing fluid to fracturing pump transport 108. In one embodiment, the electric blender may be a dual configuration blender that comprises electric motors for the rotating machinery that are located on a single transport, which is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 9,366,114, filed Apr. 6, 2012 by Todd Coli et al. and entitled \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cMobile, Modular, Electrically Powered System for use in Fracturing Underground Formations,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another embodiment, a plurality of enclosed mixer hoppers may be used to supply the proppants and additives into a plurality of blending tubs.\\n Data van 114 may be part of a control network system, where data van 114 acts as a control center configured to monitor and provide operating instructions to remotely operate blender transport 110, mobile source of electricity 102, and fracturing pump transport 108 and/or other fracturing equipment within mobile fracturing system 103. For example, data van 114 may communicate via the control network system with the variable frequency drives (VFDs) located within system 103 that operate and monitor the health of the electric motors used to drive the pumps on fracturing pump transports 108. In one embodiment, data van 114 may communicate with the variety of fracturing equipment of system 103 using a control network system that has a ring topology. A ring topology may reduce the amount of control cabling used for fracturing operations and increase the capacity and speed of data transfers and communication.\\nOther fracturing equipment shown in FIG. 1, such as water tanks, chemical storage of chemical additives, hydration unit, sand conveyor, and sandbox storage are known by persons of ordinary skill in the art, and therefore are not discussed in further detail. In one or more embodiments of mobile fracturing system 103, one or more of the other fracturing equipment shown in FIG. 1 may be configured to receive power generated from mobile source of electricity 102. The control network system for mobile fracturing system 103 may remotely synchronize and/or slave the electric blender of blender transport 110 with the electric motors of fracturing pump transports 108. Unlike a conventional diesel-powered blender, the electric blenders may perform rate changes to the pump rate change mounted on fracturing pump transports 108. In other words, if the pumps within fracturing pump transports 108 perform a rate change increase, the electric blender within blender transport 110 may also automatically compensate its rate and ancillary equipment, such as the sand conveyor, to accommodate the rate change. Manual commands from an operator may not be used or needed to perform the rate change.\\nMobile source of electricity 102 may be a part of mobile fracturing system 103 used at well site 101 as described in FIG. 1. Alternately, mobile source of electricity 102 may be a part of another system that utilizes mobile electric power generated by the power generation transport for operating electrical equipment. The mobile source of electricity may be configured to be transportable to different locations. For example, in case the mobile source of electricity is part of the mobile fracturing system, the mobile source of electricity may be configured to be transportable to different well sites along with other equipment (e.g., fracturing pump transports) that is part of the mobile fracturing system and may not be left behind after completing fracturing operations.\\nRegardless of the application, the mobile source of electricity may include a power generation transport that is configured as a single transport that improves mobility by simplifying and minimizing operations for the mobilization and de-mobilization process. For example, the mobile source of electricity may improve mobility by enabling a mobilization and de-mobilization time period of about 24 hours. The mobile source of electricity incorporates a single transport footprint, where the same transport may be used in transportation and operational modes, and be configured as a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098self-sufficient\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 transport that carries all ancillary equipment for mobile electric power generation. To provide electric power at one or more locations (e.g., well sites), the mobile source of electricity may be designed to unitize and mobilize a gas turbine and a generator adapted to convert hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas, into electricity. Although FIGS. 2A-3D illustrate embodiments of implementing a mobile source of electricity using a single transport, other embodiments of the mobile source of electricity may mount some of the ancillary components shown in FIGS. 2A-3D on a separate transport, without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.\\n FIGS. 2A-2D are schematic diagrams of an embodiment of power generation transport 200 (e.g., gas turbine generator transport, mobile source of electricity 102, and the like). FIG. 2A illustrates a side-profile view of power generation transport 200 with enclosure 290 that surrounds components within power generation transport 200 and that includes cavities for generator air inlets 217A for drawing air into enclosure 290 for ventilation and cooling of a generator housed in enclosure 290, and cavities (e.g., openings) for turbine air inlets 215A for drawing air into enclosure 290 for combustion by a gas turbine housed in enclosure 290 and for ventilating enclosure 290.\\n FIG. 2B illustrates a side-profile view of power generation transport 200 that depicts components within enclosure 290, while power generation transport 200 is in a transportation mode. As shown in FIG. 2B, power generation transport 200 may comprise the following equipment: gas conditioning skid 205, black start generator 210, power source 225, power source air inlet filter housing 215B, power source inlet plenum 220, power source exhaust collector 230, exhaust coupling member 232, power source exhaust stack 235 (e.g., exhaust implement), gearbox 240, generator shaft 245, generator 250, generator air inlet filter housing 217B, generator ventilation outlet 219, generator breaker 255, transformer 260, starter motor 265, control system 280, and control room 285. Other components not shown in FIG. 2B, but which may also be located on power generation transport 200 include a turbine lube oil system, a fire suppression system, a generator lube oil system, and the like. In one embodiment, power source 225 may be a gas turbine. In another embodiment, power source 225 may be another type of power source (e.g., diesel engine). Power source 225 is hereinafter referred to interchangeably as gas turbine 225. However, as stated above, power source 225 may correspond to other types of turbine or non-turbine-based power sources that are capable of generating sufficient mechanical energy.\\n Gas turbine 225 may be a General Electric (GE) NovaLT5 turbine to generate mechanical energy (e.g., rotation of a shaft) from a hydrocarbon fuel source, such as natural gas, liquefied natural gas, condensate, and/or other liquid fuels. As shown in FIG. 2B, a shaft (not shown) of gas turbine 225 is connected to gearbox 240 and shaft 245 of generator 250 such that generator 250 converts the supplied mechanical energy from the rotation of shaft 245 to produce electric power. Gas turbine 225 may be a commercially available gas turbine such as a General Electric NovaLT5 gas turbine, a Pratt and Whitney gas turbine, or any other similar gas turbine. Generator 250 may be a commercially available generator such as a Brush generator, a WEG generator, or other similar generator configured to generate a compatible amount of electric power. For example, the combination of gas turbine 225, gearbox 240, and generator 250 within power generation transport 200 may generate electric power from a range of at least about 1 megawatt (MW) to about 15 MW (e.g., 5.6 MW). Other types of gas turbine/generator combinations with power ranges greater than about 15 MW or less than about 1 MW may also be used depending on the application requirement. In one embodiment, to increase mobility of power generation transport 200 and so that power generation transport 200 can be configured as a single transport, gas turbine 225 may be configured to fit within a dimension of about 14.5 feet long and about 4 feet in diameter and/or generator 250 may be configured to fit within a dimension of about 18 feet long and about 7 feet wide.\\n Generator 250 may be housed within enclosure 290 that includes air ventilation fans internal and/or external to generator 250 that draw air into air inlets 217A (FIGS. 2A and 2D) located on the sides and/or top roof of enclosure 290, provide the drawn air to cool generator 250 via generator air inlet filter housing 217B including one or more air inlet filters, and discharge air out on the top and/or sides of enclosure 290 via generator ventilation air outlet 219. Transport 200 may include appropriate ducts, piping, conduits or other structure to communicatively couple air inlets 217A and air inlet filter housing 217B with a cooling surface or an external surface of generator 250 for cooling and ventilation, and to further communicatively couple the cooling and/or external surface of generator 250 with air outlet 219. As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2D, air inlets 217A and air outlet 219 may be provided so as to be flush with the outer surface (e.g., longitudinal side surfaces and/or top or roof surface) of enclosure 290 of transport 200. Other embodiments may have outlet 219 positioned on different locations of enclosure 290. In one embodiment, generator air inlets 217A may be inlet louvres and generator ventilation outlets 219 may be outlet louvres that protect the generator from weather elements. A separate generator ventilation stack unit may be mounted on the top and/or side of enclosure 290 power generation transport 200.\\n Enclosure 290 may also comprise gas turbine inlet filter housing 215B including one or more air inlet filters configured to provide combustion air via one or more inlet plenums 220 to gas turbine 225. Gas turbine inlet filter housing 215B may also be configured to provide ventilation air to ventilate an interior of enclosure 290. Although not shown in FIGS. 2A-2D, ventilation fans may also be located within gas turbine inlet filter housing 215B. Additional enclosure 290 ventilation inlets may be added to increase the amount of ventilation air. The ventilation air may also be used to cool gas turbine 225 in the operational mode. The combustion air may be air that is supplied to an intake port of gas turbine 225 via inlet plenum 220 to aid in the production of the mechanical energy. Inlet plenum 220 may be configured to collect the filtered intake air from gas turbine inlet filter housing 215B and supply the intake air to the intake port of gas turbine 225.\\nIn one embodiment, gas turbine inlet filter housing 215B may be mounted on enclosure 290 and fixedly positioned to be aligned with and coupled to inlet plenum 220 to provide combustion air to the intake port of gas turbine 225. Gas turbine air inlet filter housing 215B may also comprise a plurality of silencers to reduce noise. As shown in FIGS. 2A-2D, air inlets 215A are provided so as to be flush with the side and/or top surface of enclosure 290 of power generation transport 200. Air inlets 215A are aligned and communicated with an intake or opening of gas turbine air inlet filter housing 215B to filter and flow the combustion air and ventilation air to an interior of enclosure 290.\\nAs shown in FIGS. 2B and 2C, exhaust collector 230 may be configured to be detachably coupled to an exhaust port 231 (e.g., outlet port) of gas turbine 225 to collect exhaust air and supply the exhaust air to gas turbine exhaust stack 235 (e.g., exhaust implement). The embodiment shown in FIGS. 2B-2C illustrates exhaust stack 235 as being vertically coupled so as to be stacked on top of exhaust collector 230 (i.e., exhaust stack 235 positioned on top of exhaust collector 230). However, this may not necessarily be the case. Any suitable arrangement and coupling between exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 may be employed so that exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 may be housed within dimensions of power generation transport 200 (including dimensions of underbelly truss or skid 295) during the transportation mode (FIG. 2B). Gas turbine exhaust stack 235 may comprise a plurality of silencers that reduce noise from power generation transport 200 during operation.\\nDuring operation (i.e., when gas turbine generator transport 200 is in an operational mode), as shown in FIG. 2C, one or both of exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 may be configured to be jacked up (e.g., using hydraulics) by a predetermined vertical distance to an elevated standing position. Further, to improve mobility of power generation transport 200 during transportation (i.e., when gas turbine generator transport 200 is in a transportation mode), as shown in FIG. 2B, one or both of exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 may be configured to be jacked down (e.g., using hydraulics) by the predetermined vertical distance so that a top surface of exhaust stack 235 becomes flush with the top or roof of enclosure 290 of transport 200.\\nTo jack one or both of exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 up and down (e.g., raise and lower exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235), power generation transport 200 may include elevating system 237 that changeably adjusts the positioning and alignment of exhaust collector 230 and/or exhaust stack 235 so that the exhaust air outlet port 231 of gas turbine 225 can be aligned with and coupled to exhaust collector 230 via exhaust coupling member 232. In one embodiment, elevating system 237 may be a hydraulic system. Alternately, elevating system 237 may be implemented using an electric motor, rack-and-pinion system, pneumatic system, pulley-based system, and the like. For example, elevating system 237 may vertically move (e.g., raise, lift, elevate and the like) exhaust collector 230 and/or exhaust stack 235 to an elevated standing position such that exhaust coupling member 232 of exhaust collector 230 becomes aligned with the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225, without attaching exhaust collector and/or exhaust stack 235 to an external apparatus (e.g., a tractor or other type of motor vehicle, external mechanical means, external mechanical apparatus, crane, and the like). Elevating system 237 may comprise a plurality of hydraulic cylinders and/or support feet used to support exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 vertically and/or horizontally. For example, elevating system 237 may comprise a first member (e.g., hydraulic cylinder) that elevates or raises exhaust collector 230 and/or exhaust stack 235 vertically to an elevated standing position, and aligns coupling member 232 of exhaust collector 230 with the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225, and a second member (e.g., hydraulic cylinder) that moves exhaust collector 230 (and optionally, exhaust stack 235) in a lateral or horizontal direction to connect or communicate coupling member 232 of exhaust collector 230 with the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225.\\nAs shown in FIG. 2B, exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 may be mounted to initially stack lower vertically during transportation mode, such that the top of exhaust stack 235 is flush with the roof of enclosure 290 of transport 200. In the operational mode shown in FIG. 2C, exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 may be raised up vertically without using any external mechanical means or apparatus by elevating system 237. In the operational mode, exhaust collector 230 and gas turbine exhaust stack 235 may be positioned using hydraulics, pneumatics, and/or electric motors and pulleys such that gas turbine exhaust collector 230 aligns with and couples to the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225 via coupling member 232. In one embodiment, elevating system 237 may vertically move (e.g., raise, extend, or lift) exhaust collector 230 and/or exhaust stack 235 by a predetermined vertical distance (e.g., around four feet) when setting up power generation transport 200 for operation in the operational mode. As shown in FIG. 2C, in the operational mode, exhaust stack 235 may thus extend vertically upward and out of a top side of enclosure 290 by around four feet, thereby reducing exhaust noise and safely releasing (extremely hot) exhaust air into the atmosphere without posing danger to any equipment and/or an operator working in a vicinity of power generation transport 200. Further, as shown in FIG. 2B, in the transportation mode, elevating system 237 may safely lower exhaust stack 235 back down so that exhaust coupling member 232 of exhaust collector 230 is decoupled from the air outlet of gas turbine 225, and exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 are vertically lowered by a predetermined vertical distance (e.g., around four feet) so as to extend down (e.g., lower) and be housed by enclosure 290. As shown in FIG. 2B, when in the transportation mode, at least a portion of exhaust collector 230 may also extend below base frame 202 (e.g., the floor, and the like) of enclosure 290 so as to be supported by underbelly truss or skid 295 that extends below base frame 202 of enclosure 290.\\nAs explained above, in the operational mode shown in FIG. 2C, exhaust collector 230 may connect with the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225 via exhaust coupling member 232. Exhaust coupling member 232 may include one or more connection or coupling members that are provided fixedly on one or both of exhaust collector 230 and the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225. Any form of connection may be used that provides coupling between gas turbine 225 and exhaust collector 230 without using a crane, forklift, and/or any other external mechanical means to connect the connection members in place and/or to connect coupling member 232 of exhaust collector 230 to the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225. The connection members may comprise a duct and/or an expansion joint or a connection joint to matingly connect exhaust collector 230 to gas turbine 225. Thus, exhaust coupling member 232 may move and connect (e.g., using elevating system 237 and/or other actuator) to the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225 without using any external mechanical means.\\nIn the embodiment shown in FIGS. 2B and 2C, exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 disposed on base frame 202 of power generation transport 200 are movable relative to the fixedly mounted gas turbine 225. That is, exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 are adapted to be jacked up and down by a predetermined vertical distance by using elevating system 237 to couple/decouple exhaust collector 230 to/from the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225. However, in another embodiment, exhaust collector 230 and exhaust stack 235 may be fixedly mounted on base frame 202 and coupled with the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225 to release exhaust air. As shown in FIGS. 2E-2F, power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may include exhaust collector 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 disposed on base frame 202 and fixedly mounted to the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225, and exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may be disposed on base frame 202 and fixedly mounted to exhaust collector 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 such that a top portion or surface of exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 is flush with the top or roof of enclosure 290 (FIGS. 2E and 2F) in both the transportation and operational modes. In this embodiment, in order to safely release the hot exhaust air into the atmosphere from exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2, power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may further include exhaust stack extension 238 (e.g., exhaust implement) that is housed within exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 in the transportation mode (FIG. 2E) and that is configured to be raised or elevated from within exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 in the operational mode (FIG. 2F) by elevating system 237\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2.\\n Exhaust collector 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may be fixedly mounted to base frame 202 of power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 and communicatively coupled to the exhaust port 231 of gas turbine 225 via exhaust coupling member 232 to collect exhaust air and supply the exhaust air to gas turbine exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2. Exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may be fixedly mounted to base frame 202 and vertically coupled so as to be stacked on top of exhaust collector 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 (i.e., exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 positioned on top of exhaust collector 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2) and so that the top of exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 is flush with the roof of enclosure 290. With this configuration, exhaust collector 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 and exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may be fixedly mounted and housed within dimensions of power generation transport 200 during both the transportation mode (FIG. 2E) and the operational mode (FIG. 2F).\\nDuring operation (i.e., when gas turbine generator transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 is in an operational mode), as shown in FIG. 2F, exhaust stack extension 238 (e.g., exhaust implement) may be configured to be raised (e.g., using hydraulics) by a predetermined vertical distance to an elevated standing position. Exhaust stack extension 238 may be configured to extend vertically from within exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 by operating elevating system 237\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 disposed on power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2. Exhaust stack extension 238 may be raised up vertically by elevating system 237\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 without using any external mechanical means or apparatus.\\n Exhaust stack extension 238 may be configured for noise control. For example, exhaust stack extension 238 may comprise a plurality of silencers that reduce noise from power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 during operation. Exhaust stack extension 238 may be mounted to exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 and disposed on power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 so as to be housed within exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 during the transportation mode (FIG. 2E) and so that the top of exhaust stack extension 238 is flush with the top or roof of enclosure 290. In the operational mode, exhaust stack extension 238 may be positioned by elevating system 237\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 such that exhaust stack extension 238 raises from within the fixedly mounted exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 and an air intake end of exhaust stack extension 238 becomes flush with the roof of enclosure 290 and the air exhaust end of exhaust stack extension 238 projects out of the top of enclosure 290 by a predetermined vertical distance (e.g., around four feet). Exhaust stack extension 238 may thus extend vertically upward and out of a top side of enclosure 290 by around four feet, thereby reducing exhaust noise and safely releasing (extremely hot) exhaust air into the atmosphere without posing danger to any equipment and/or an operator working in a vicinity of power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2. Further, as shown in FIG. 2E, in the transportation mode, elevating system 237\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may safely lower exhaust stack extension 238 back down by a predetermined vertical distance (e.g., around four feet) so as to extend down (e.g., lower) and be housed within enclosure 290. Exhaust stack extension 238 may thus be housed within an interior of exhaust stack 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 so that the air exhaust end of exhaust stack extension 238 becomes flush with the top or roof of enclosure 290.\\nAs shown in FIGS. 2A-2F, by adapting air inlet filter housing 215B and gas  turbine exhaust stack  235, 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 to be mounted on the same/single transport or frame 202 as the transport or frame 202 for inlet plenum 220, gas turbine 225, exhaust collector 230, and generator 250,  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 provides a relatively quick rig-up and/or rig-down time that eliminates the use of heavy lift cranes, forklifts, and/or any other external mechanical means or apparatus at the operational site. To improve mobility over a variety of roadways,  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 in FIGS. 2A-2F may have a maximum height of about 13 feet and 6 inches, a maximum width of about 8 feet and 6 inches, and a maximum length of about 70 feet. Further,  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may comprise at least three axles used to support and distribute the weight on  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2. Other embodiments of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may be transports that exceed three axles depending on the total transport weight. The dimensions and the number of axles may be adjusted to allow for transport over roadways that typically mandate certain height, length, and weight restrictions.\\nIn one embodiment, gas turbine 225, gearbox 240, generator 250, and other components of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 shown in FIGS. 2B-2F may be supported on  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 by being mounted on engineered base frame 202, a sub-base, sub-skid, or any other sub-structure of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2. For example, base frame 202 may mount and align air inlet filter housing 215B, inlet plenum 220, gas turbine 225,  exhaust collector  230, 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2,  exhaust stack  235, 235\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2, exhaust stack extension 238, elevating  system  237, 237\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2, gearbox 240, generator 250, gas conditioning system 205, and black start generator 210 on  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2, 300. Further, the single engineered base frame 202 may be used to mount and to align the connections between gas turbine 225, gearbox 240, generator 250, inlet plenum 220, and  exhaust collector  230, 230\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 and/or to lower gas turbine 225, gearbox 240, and generator 250 by configuring for a flush mount to single engineered base frame 202. Engineered base frame 202 may allow for easier alignment and connection of gas turbine 225, gearbox 240, generator 250, and other components of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 compared to using a separate sub-base for gas turbine 225 and generator 250. Other embodiments of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 may use a plurality of sub-bases so as to, for example, mount gas turbine 225 and gearbox 240 on one sub-base and mount generator 250 on another sub-base.\\n FIGS. 2B-2F further illustrate that gas conditioning skid 205, black start generator 210, generator breaker 255, transformer 260, starter motor 265, control system 280, and control room 285 may be located on  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 (e.g., mounted on base frame 202). Gas conditioning skid 205 (e.g., gas conditioning unit or system) may be adapted to receive hydrocarbon gas (e.g., natural gas) from a hydrocarbon fuel source (e.g., a gas pipeline). Gas conditioning skid 205 may include a gas conditioning system that regulates hydrocarbon gas pressures, heats the hydrocarbon gas, separates out liquids from the hydrocarbon gas (e.g., water), and/or filters out unwanted contaminants (e.g., sand) from the hydrocarbon gas. Gas conditioning skid 205 may also include a compression system that utilizes an electric motor to drive one or more compressors to compress the hydrocarbon gas to a designated pressure (e.g., about 525 pounds per square inch (PSI)). Gas conditioning skid 205 may subsequently output the processed hydrocarbon gas to a gas storage system that siphons a portion of the processed hydrocarbon gas to fill one or more gas storage tanks (not shown). Prior to storing the processed hydrocarbon gas within the gas storage tanks, the gas storage system may further compress the hydrocarbon gas to a relatively higher pressure level (e.g., about 3,000 PSI or 5,000 PSI). The remaining portion of the processed hydrocarbon gas bypasses any additional processing by gas conditioning skid 205 and may be directly output to gas turbine 225 for electric power generation. When the pressure of the hydrocarbon gas received by the compression system of gas conditioning skid 205 starts to drop below a predetermined backup pressure (e.g., about 500 PSI), the gas storage system of skid 205 may release the hydrocarbon gas stored within the gas storage tanks so as to output hydrocarbon gas that is free of contaminants to gas turbine 225 at a regulated and acceptable pressure level.\\n Black start generator 210 may be configured to provide power to control, ignite, or start gas turbine 225. In addition, black start generator 210 may provide ancillary power where peak electric power demand exceeds the electric power output of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2. Black start generator 210 may comprise a diesel generator that may provide testing, standby, peaking, and/or other emergency backup power functionality for  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 or other equipment powered by  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2. Generator breaker 255 may comprise one or more circuit breakers that are configured to protect generator 250 from current and/or voltage fault conditions. Generator breaker 255 may be a medium voltage (MV) circuit breaker switchboard. In one embodiment, generator breaker 255 may include three panels, two for generator 250 and one for a feeder that protect relays on the circuit breaker. Other embodiments may include one or two or more than three panels for generator breaker 255. In one embodiment, generator breaker 255 may be a vacuum circuit breaker.\\n Transformer 260 may be a step-down transformer that is configured to lower generator 250 voltage to a lower voltage to provide control power to power generation transport 200. Gearbox 240 is provided to reduce the turbine output rpm to the operational rpm of the generator. The starter motor 265 can be an electric motor coupled to the gearbox and/or turbine to start the turbine. Control system 280 may be configured to control, monitor, regulate, and adjust power output of gas turbine 225 and generator 250. For example, in the embodiment where  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 is implemented to provide power for a hydraulic fracturing operation at a well site, control system 280 may monitor and balance the load produced by the fracturing operations by generating enough electric power to match the load demands. Similarly, in other applications (other than hydraulic fracturing), control system 280 may monitor and balance the load produced by the power consuming system or equipment, and generate electric power to match load demands. Control system 280 may also be configured to synchronize and communicate with a control network system that allows a data van or other computing systems located in a remote location (e.g., off a well site) to control, monitor, regulate, and adjust power output of generator 250. The control room 285 is the section of power generation transport 200 that houses all the electronics and controls of generator 250.\\nAlthough FIGS. 2B-2F illustrate that gas conditioning skid 205, black start generator 210, generator breaker 255, transformer 260, starter motor 265, control system 280, and control room 285 may be mounted on base frame 202 of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2, other embodiments of power generation transport 200 may mount one or more of gas conditioning skid 205, black start generator 210, generator breaker 255, transformer 260, starter motor 265, control system 280, and control room 285 in other locations (e.g. switch gear transport 112).\\nOther equipment that may also be located on  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2, but not shown in FIGS. 2A-2F include the turbine lube oil system, gas fuel valves, generator lube oil system, gearbox lube oil system, and fire suppression system. The lube oil systems or consoles, which generally refer to both the turbine lube oil system, gearbox lube oil system, landing & leveling legs and associated hydraulics and generator lube oil system within this disclosure, may be configured to provide a generator lube oil filtering and cooling system and a turbine lube oil filtering and cooling system. In one embodiment, the turbine lube oil console area of the transport may also contain the fire suppression systems, which may comprise sprinklers, water mist, clean agent, foam sprinkler, carbon dioxide, and/or other equipment used to suppress a fire or provide fire protection for gas turbine 225. The mounting of the turbine, gearbox & generator lube oil consoles and the fire suppression system onto  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 reduces this transport's footprint by eliminating the need for an auxiliary transport and connections for the turbine, gearbox and generator lube oil, filtering, cooling systems and the fire suppression systems to the gas turbine generator transport. The turbine, gearbox, and generator lube oil systems may be mounted on a skid that is located underneath generator 250 or any other location on  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2.\\nIn the embodiment shown in FIGS. 2A-2F, gas turbine air inlets 215A and air inlet filter housing 215B are mounted along a top surface of enclosure 290 (FIG. 2D) so that inlets 215A and filter housing 215B extend substantially horizontally above gearbox 240 and gas turbine 225. However, the number and arrangement of inlets 215A, filters, and filter housing 215B is not limiting. Any number or arrangement of inlets 215A, filters, and/or filter housing 215B may be employed depending on, e.g., the volume of ventilation air required, the amount of clean air and the air flow dynamics needed to supply combustion air to gas turbine 225, and the like. An alternate embodiment of power generation transport 300 is shown in FIGS. 3A-3D. Power generation transport 300 shown in FIGS. 3A-3D is similar to power generation transport 200 shown in FIGS. 2A-2F except that the arrangement of gas turbine air inlets 315A and gas turbine inlet filter housing 315B is different. As shown in FIGS. 3A-3D, gas turbine air inlets 315A and gas turbine inlet filter housing 315B extend substantially vertically between gas turbine 225 and generator 250. Since other components of power generation transport 300 is shown in FIGS. 3A-3D are the same as those of  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 of FIGS. 2A-2F, detailed description thereof is omitted here.\\n FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an embodiment of method 400 to provide a mobile source of electricity for any operation requiring a mobile power source (e.g., hydraulic fracturing at a well site as shown in FIG. 1). Method 400 may start at block 402 by transporting a mobile source of electricity (e.g.,  power generation transport  200, 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2, 300) to a remote location. Method 400 may then move to block 404 and convert the mobile source of electricity from transportation mode to operational mode. The same transport may be used during the conversion from transportation mode to operational mode. In other words, transports are not added and/or removed when setting up the mobile source of electricity for operational mode. Additionally, method 400 may be performed without the use of a forklift, crane, and/or other external mechanical means to transition the mobile source of electricity into operational mode. Method 400 may then move to block 405 where the exhaust collector is coupled with the gas turbine without utilizing any external mechanical apparatus. The conversion and coupling processes for a single transport trailer are described above in detail in connection with FIGS. 2A-3D.\\n Method 400 may then move to block 406 and generate electricity using the mobile source of electricity to power a variety of operations requiring a mobile power source (e.g., hydraulic fracturing). In one embodiment, method 400 may generate electricity by converting hydrocarbon fuel into electricity using a gas turbine generator. Method 400 may then move to block 407 where the exhaust collector and the gas turbine are decoupled from each other without utilizing any external mechanical apparatus. Alternately, in case of the embodiment of power generation transport 200\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 shown in FIGS. 2F-2E, method 400 at block 407 may involve lowering the exhaust stack extension extending vertically upward from the top or roof of the enclosure of the power generation transport back downward by utilizing an elevating system disposed on the transport and without utilizing any external mechanical apparatus.\\n Method 400 may then move to block 408 and convert the mobile source of electricity from operational mode to transportation mode. Similar to block 404, and as explained in detail in connection with FIGS. 2A-3D, the conversion and decoupling/lowering processes for  blocks  407 and 408 may use the same transports without using a forklift, crane, and/or other external mechanical means to transition the mobile source of electricity back to transportation mode. Method 400 may then move to block 410 to remove the mobile source of electricity along from the location after mobile power is no longer needed.\\nAt least one embodiment is disclosed and variations, combinations, and/or modifications of the embodiment(s) and/or features of the embodiment(s) made by a person having ordinary skill in the art are within the scope of the disclosure.

The entirety of each of the foregoing applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein.\\nFIELD OF USE\\nThis invention is in the field of devices to ablate muscle cells and nerve fibers for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and/or hypertension.\\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\\nAt the present time, physicians often treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) using radio frequency (RF) catheter systems to ablate conducting tissue in the wall of the Left Atrium of the heart around the ostium of the pulmonary veins. Similar technology, using radiofrequency energy, has been used inside the renal arteries to ablate sympathetic and other nerve fibers that run in the wall of the aorta on the outside of the renal arteries, in order to treat high blood pressure. In both cases these are elaborate and expensive catheter systems that can cause thermal, cryoablative, or other injury to surrounding tissue. Many of these systems also require significant capital outlays for the reusable equipment that lies outside of the body, including RF generation systems and the fluid handling systems for cryoablative catheters.\\nBecause of the similarities of anatomy, for the purposes of this disclosure, the term target vessel will refer here to either the pulmonary vein for AF ablation applications or the renal artery for hypertension therapy applications. The term ostial wall will refer to the wall of the Left Atrium surrounding a pulmonary vein for AF application and to the wall of the aorta for the hypertension application.\\nIn the case of atrial fibrillation ablation, the ablation of tissue surrounding multiple pulmonary veins can be technically challenging and very time consuming. This is particularly so if one uses RF catheters that can only ablate one focus at a time. There is also a failure rate using these types of catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation. The failures of the current approaches are related to the challenges in creating reproducible circumferential ablation of tissue around the ostium (peri-ostial) of a pulmonary vein.\\nThere are also potential risks using the current technologies for RF ablation to create sympathetic nerve denervation inside the renal artery for the treatment of hypertension. The long-term sequelae of applying RF energy inside the renal artery itself are unknown, but this could lead to late restenosis, embolization of debris into the renal parenchyma, or other problems inside the renal artery. There may also be uneven or incomplete sympathetic nerve ablation, particularly if there are anatomic abnormalities, or atherosclerotic or fibrotic disease inside the renal artery, such that there is nonhomogeneous delivery of RF energy. This could lead to treatment failures, or the need for additional and dangerous levels of RF energy to ablate the nerves that run along the adventitial plane of the renal artery. There are also significant safety issues with current technologies related to very long fluoroscopy and procedure times that lead to high levels of radiation exposure to both the patient and the operator, and may increase stroke risk in atrial fibrillation ablation.\\nFinally, while injection of ethanol as an ablative substance is used within the heart and other parts of the body, there has been no development of an ethanol injection system specifically designed for circular ablation of the ostial wall of a target vessel.\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\\nThe present invention Circular Ablation System (CAS) is capable of producing damage in the tissue that surrounds the ostium of a blood vessel in a relatively short period of time using a disposable catheter requiring no additional capital equipment. The primary focus of use of CAS is in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension.\\nSpecifically, there is a definite need for such a catheter system that is capable of highly efficient, and reproducible circumferential ablation of the muscle fibers and conductive tissue in the wall of the Left Atrium of the heart surrounding the ostium of the pulmonary veins which could interrupt atrial fibrillation (AF) and other cardiac arrhythmias.\\nThis type of system may also have major advantages over other current technologies by allowing time efficient and safe circumferential ablation of the nerves in the wall of the aorta surrounding the renal artery (peri-ostial renal tissue) in order to damage the sympathetic nerve fibers that track from the peri-ostial aortic wall into the renal arteries, and thus improve the control and treatment of hypertension. Other potential applications of this approach may evolve over time.\\nThe present invention is a catheter which includes multiple expandable injector tubes arranged circumferentially around the body of the CAS near its distal end. Each tube includes an injector needle at its distal end. There is a penetration limiting member proximal to the distal end of each needle so that the needles will only penetrate into the tissue of the ostial wall to a preset distance. This will reduce the likelihood of perforation of the ostial wall and will optimize the depth of injection for each application. The injector needles are in fluid communication with an injection lumen in the catheter body which is in fluid communication with an injection port at the proximal end of the CAS. Such an injection port would typically include a standard connector such as a Luer connector used to connect to a source of ablative fluid.\\nThe expandable injector tubes may be self-expanding made of a springy material or a memory metal such as NITINOL or they may be expandable by mechanical means. For example, the expandable legs with distal injection needles could be mounted to the outside of an expandable balloon whose diameter is controllable by the pressure used to inflate the balloon.\\nThe entire CAS is designed to be advanced over a guide wire in either an over the wire configuration where the guide wire lumen runs the entire length of the CAS or a rapid exchange configuration where the guide wire exits the catheter body at least 10 cm distal to the proximal end of the CAS and runs outside of the catheter shaft for its proximal section.\\nThe distal end of the CAS also includes a centering means at or near its distal end. The centering means could be a mechanical structure or an expandable balloon. The centering means will help to ensure that the injector tubes will be engaged circumferentially around and outside of the ostium of the target vessel. If the injector tubes are expanded by a balloon, then it is envisioned that the distal portion of the balloon would have conical or cylindrical distal portions that would facilitate centering the CAS in the target vessel.\\nThe CAS would also be typically packaged inside an insertion tube that constrains the self-expanding legs prior to insertion into a guiding catheter, and allows the distal end of the CAS to be inserted into the proximal end of a guiding catheter or introducer sheath.\\nThe CAS might also be packaged to include an outer sheath that runs the entire length of the CAS so as to cover and protect the needles and also protect them from getting caught as the CAS is advanced distally to the desired location.\\nIt is also envisioned that the injection needles could be formed from a radiopaque material such as tantalum or tungsten or coated with a radiopaque material such as gold or platinum so as to make them clearly visible using fluoroscopy.\\nIt is also envisioned that one or more of the injector needles could be electrically connected to the proximal end of the CAS so as to also act as a diagnostic electrode(s) for evaluation of the electrical activity in the area of the ostial wall.\\nIt is also envisioned that one could attach 2 or more of the expandable legs to an electrical or RF source to deliver electric current or RF energy around the circumference of a target vessel to the ostial wall to perform tissue ablation.\\nFor use in the treatment of AF the present invention CAS would be used with the following steps:\\n    Access to the left atrium via a large peripheral vein, such as the femoral vein, typically with the insertion of a sheath. Use a trans septal approach to get into the left atrium, via the vein, to the right atrium, to enter the left atrium. This approach is a well known procedure. Advance a guide wire and guiding catheter across the inter-atrial septum into the left atrium. Using a guiding catheter with a shaped distal end or guiding sheath, engage the first targeted pulmonary vein. This can be confirmed with contrast injections as needed. Advance a guide wire through the guiding catheter into the pulmonary vein. Place the distal end of an insertion tube which constrains the distal end of the CAS into the proximal end of the guiding catheter. Advance the distal end of the CAS into and advance the CAS through the guiding catheter, and tracking over the guidewire, until it is just proximal to the distal end of the guiding catheter. Advance the CAS over the guidewire until the distal portion of its centering means is within the target vessel. Expand the centering means. If the centering means is cylindrical, expand it until it is just slightly less (1-4 mm less) than the diameter of the target vessel. This will ensure that the catheter will be roughly \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccentered\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d within the target vessel to enable the circumferential deployment of the legs of the CAS around the target vessel ostium so that injection will be centered around the ostium of the target vessel. Pull back the guiding catheter to leave space for the expanding injector tubes to open. Expand the injector tubes or let them expand if they are self-expanding. If balloon expandable, adjust the balloon pressure to get the desired diameter. If selfexpanding, the circumference of the self-expansion can be adjusted in vivo by varying the distance of the pullback of the guiding catheter. That is, if one wants a smaller diameter (circumference) expansion to fit the ostial dimension of that specific target vessel, one can partially constrain the injector tube expansion by not fully retracting the guiding catheter all the way to the base of the tubes. However, the preferred method is to have the final opening distance be preset for the CAS, with the injector tubes fully expanded to their memory shape. Typically the CAS size would be pre-selected based on the anticipated or measured diameter of the ablation ring to be created, such that the fully expanded injector tubes create the correctly sized ablation \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cring.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Advance the CAS until the injector needles at the distal end of the self-expanding injector tubes penetrate the ostial wall, with the penetration depth being a fixed distance limited by the penetration limiting member attached to each needle at a preset distance proximal to the distal end of the needle. If the centering means is conical, as the CAS is advanced distally, the cone will engage the ostium of the vein which will center the CAS. Attach a syringe or injection system to the injection connector at the CAS proximal end. Engagement of the ostial wall can be confirmed by injection of a small volume of iodinated contrast via a syringe, through the needles, prior to injection of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cablative\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d fluid such as alcohol. If there is contrast \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cstaining\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d of the tissue this will confirm that the needles are engaged into the tissue and not free floating in the left atrium or aorta. Inject an appropriate volume of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) or other appropriate cytotoxic fluid from the syringe or injection system through the catheter and out of the needles into the ostial wall. A typical injection would be 1-10 ml. This should produce a multiplicity of circles of ablation (one for each needle) that will intersect to form an ablative ring around the ostium of the target vessel. Contrast could be added to the injection to allow x-ray visualization of the ablation area. Once the injection is complete, retract the CAS back into the guiding catheter, which will collapse the self-expanding injector tubes. If the device is balloon expandable deflate the balloon and retract back into the guiding catheter. In some cases, one may rotate the CAS 20-90 degrees and then repeat the injection if needed to make an even more definitive ring of ablation. The same methods as per prior steps can be repeated to ablate tissue around the one or more of the other pulmonary veins during the same procedure, as indicated to ensure AF inhibition. Remove the CAS from the guiding catheter completely. When indicated, advance appropriate diagnostic electrophysiology catheters to confirm that the ablation has been successful. Remove all remaining apparatus from the body. A similar approach can be used with the CAS, via access from a peripheral artery such as the femoral artery, to treat hypertension, via ablation of tissue in the periostial aortic wall tissue surrounding one or both of the renal arteries, with the goal of ablating afferent and/or efferent sympathetic nerve fibers entering or exiting the kidney.   \\nIt is also envisioned that two or more of the legs/injector tubes may be connected to an electrical or RF field source to allow for electrical discharge or RF ablation to enable tissue ablation of the tissue in the ostial wall.\\nIt is also envisioned that one could mount injector tubes with needles on the outer surface of an expandable balloon on the CAS in order to deliver 2 or more needles around the circumference of the ostium of a target vessel to inject ablative fluid to the ostial wall.\\nIn this case, the distal portion of the balloon could include the centering means of a cylindrical or conical shape. This embodiment could also include an elastic band covering the injector tubes where the elastic band could both help maintain a smooth outer surface of the CAS to facilitate delivery as well as act as the penetration limiting member to limit the penetration of the injection needles.\\nThus it is an object of the present invention CAS is to have a percutaneously delivered catheter that can be used to treat atrial fibrillation with a one, or more injections of an ablative fluid into the wall of the left atrium surrounding one or more pulmonary vems.\\nAnother object of the present invention CAS is to have a percutaneously delivered catheter that can be used to treat hypertension with one, or more injections of an ablative fluid into the wall of the aorta surrounding a renal artery.\\nStill another object of the present invention CAS is to have a percutaneously delivered catheter that includes a multiplicity of circumferentially expandable injector tubes, each tube having a needle at its distal end for injection of an ablative fluid into the ostial wall of a target vessel.\\nStill another object of the present invention CAS is to have a centering means located at or near the catheter's distal end. The centering means designed to allow the injector to be centered on the target vessel so that the injected ablative fluid will form an ablative ring outside of the ostium of the target vessel. The centering means can be fixed or expandable, and may include a cylindrical or conical portion.\\nAnother object of the invention is to have a penetration limiting member or means attached to the distal portion of the injector leg or as part of the distal portion of the CAS in order to limit the depth of needle penetration into the ostial wall.\\nYet another object of the present invention CAS is to have one or more of the injector needles act as diagnostic electrodes for measurement of electrical activity within the ostial wall of the target vessel.\\nThese and other objects and advantages of this invention will become obvious to a person of ordinary skill in this art upon reading of the detailed description of this invention including the associated drawings.\\n\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\n FIG. 1  is a three dimensional sketch of the distal end of the present invention Circular Ablation System (CAS).\\n FIG. 2  is a longitudinal cross sectional drawing of the distal end of the CAS.\\n FIG. 3  is a longitudinal cross sectional drawing showing area 3 of FIG. 2  which is the distal end of the self-expanding injector leg, injector needle and penetration limiter.\\n FIG. 4  is a longitudinal cross sectional drawing showing area 4 of FIG. 2  which is the proximal end of the self-expanding injector legs and how they are in fluid communication with the injection lumen of the CAS.\\n FIG. 5  is a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS with centering balloon expanded.\\n FIG. 6A is a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS with legs collapsed inside the distal end of a guiding catheter as the distal end of the CAS is inserted into the target vessel.\\n FIG. 6B is a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS after the CAS centering means has been expanded and the guiding catheter has been pulled back (retracted) allowing the self-expanding legs to expand.\\n FIG. 6C is a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS now advanced in the distal direction until the injector needles penetrate the ostial wall and the penetration limiters on each needle limit the penetration as they touch the ostial wall.

The proximal portion of the CAS 10 includes three tubes, an outer tube 12, a middle tube 14 and an inner tube 18. The guidewire 20 can be slidably advanced or removed through the guide wire lumen 13 inside of the inner tube 18. An expandable cylindrical balloon 16 is attached at its proximal end to the middle tube 14 and at its distal end to the inner tube 18. The balloon inflation lumen is located between the inner tube 18 and the middle tube 14. The balloon 16 can be inflated by injection of a fluid through the balloon inflation lumen and deflated by applying suction to the balloon inflation lumen.\\nA injector transition manifold 11 is sealed onto the outside of the middle tube 14. The outer tube 12 is sealed at its distal end onto the outside of the injector transition manifold 11. The expandable injector tubes 15 are attached at their proximal end to or through the injector transition manifold 11 so that the proximal lumen of the injector tubes 15 are in fluid communication with the fluid injection lumen 22 that lies between the middle tube 14 and the outer tube 12. The injector tubes 15 could be made of a springy metal such as L605 or the preferred embodiment being made from a memory metal such as NITINOL. A plastic hub 17 is attached to the distal end of each injector tube 15. An injector needle 19 extends distally from the distal end of each plastic hub 17. The lumen of each injector needle 19 is in fluid communication with the lumen of the expandable injector tube (leg) 15. Each hub 17 acts as a penetration limiting member to limit the penetration of the distally attached needle 19 into the ostial wall of the target vessel. In this embodiment it is envisioned that the penetration of the needles 19 would be limited to pre-set distance, for example the distance might be between 0.5 mm and 1 cm.\\n FIG. 2  is a longitudinal cross sectional drawing of the distal end of the CAS 10 in its state before it is loaded into a guiding catheter or sheath for delivery over the guide wire 20 into a human being. The proximal portion of the CAS 10 includes three tubes, an outer tube 12, a middle tube 14 and an inner tube 18. The guidewire 20 can be advanced or removed through the guide wire lumen 13 inside of the inner tube 18. An expandable cylindrical balloon 16 is attached at its proximal end to the middle tube 14 and at its distal end to the inner tube 18. The balloon 16 may be either an elastic balloon or a folded inelastic balloon such as is used for angioplasty. The proximal end of the balloon 16 is attached to the middle tube 14 and the distal end of the balloon 16 is attached to the inner tube 18 such that the area under the balloon 16 is in fluid communication with the balloon inflation lumen 24 that lies between the middle tube 14 and the inner tube 18. The balloon 16 can be inflated by injection of a fluid or gas through the balloon inflation lumen 24 and deflated by applying suction to the balloon inflation lumen 24. Normal saline solution including a fluoroscopic contrast agent would be the typical fluid used to inflate the balloon 16.\\nThe injector transition manifold 11 is sealed onto the outside of the middle tube 14. The outer tube 12 is sealed at its distal end onto the outside of the injector transition manifold 11. The expandable injector tubes 15 are attached at their proximal end through the injector transition manifold 11 so that the proximal lumen of the injector tubes 15 are in fluid communication with the fluid injection lumen 22 that lies between the middle tube 14 and the outer tube 12. FIG. 4  shows an expanded version of the area 4 of FIG. 2 . The injector tubes 15 could be made of a springy metal such as L605 or the preferred embodiment being made from a memory metal such as NITINOL. A plastic hub penetration limiter 17 with flattened distal end to act as a means of limiting the penetration of the needle 19 is attached over the distal end of each of the 8 expandable injector tubes 15. An injector needle 19 extends distally from the distal end of each plastic hub 17. The lumen of each injector needle is in fluid communication with the lumen of the expandable injector tube 15.\\n FIG. 3  is an enlarged longitudinal cross sectional drawing showing area 3 of FIG. 2  which is the distal end of the self-expanding injector tube 15 with injector tube lumen 21, injector needle 19 and penetration limiter 17. While FIG. 3  shows the limiters 17 as being symmetric around the injector tube 15, it is also envisioned that an asymmetric penetration limiter, for example a limiter with significant material only on the inside might be preferable as it would be less likely to catch on a guiding catheter when the CAS 10 is advanced through or retracted back into the guiding catheter at the end of the procedure.\\n FIG. 4  is an enlarged longitudinal cross sectional drawing of the CAS 10 showing area 4 of FIG. 2  which is the proximal end of the self-expanding injector tubes 15 with lumens 21. FIG. 4  shows detail on how the lumens 21 of the injector tubes 15 are in fluid communication with the injection lumen 22 of the CAS 10. Specifically, the proximal section of each injector tube 15 is inserted through a hole in the injector transition manifold 11 and fixedly attached and sealed to the manifold 11 so that the proximal end of the each tube 15 has its proximal end and opening in fluid communication with the injector lumen 22 that lies between the outer tube 12 and the middle tube 14 of the CAS 10. As another way of achieving this structure it is also conceived that the injector manifold 11 might be a single piece of plastic molded over the proximal ends of the injector tubes 15 in a molding operation prior to assembly.\\n FIG. 5  shows a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 with centering balloon 16\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 expanded. Also shown are the outer tube 12, middle tubeH and inner tube 18 with guidewire 20. The injector tubes 15 protrude in the distal direction from the distal end of the injector manifold 11 and have hubs 17 (penetration limiting members) with injector needles 19 at their distal end. The expanded balloon 16\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 should be inflated to be just slightly less than the diameter of the target vessel. This will allow it to act as a centering means without causing undue injury to the target vessel wall. Ideally, the balloon 16\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 would be a low pressure elastic balloon where the diameter can be adjusted by using the appropriate pressure to inflate the balloon 16\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 through the balloon inflation lumen 24. It is also conceived that the CAS 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 would have a non-compliant or semicompliant molded folded balloon with a limited diameter range vs. pressure such as is used in an angioplasty balloons.\\n FIG. 6A is a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS 10 with injector tubes 15 collapsed inside the distal end of a guiding catheter 30 as the distal end of the CAS 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 is inserted into the target vessel over the guide wire 20. The distal end of the guiding catheter 30 would normally first be placed inside of the ostium of the target vessel (engaged) and is shown here slightly back from the ostium as it would be during the first part of its distal retraction. From the position shown in FIG. 6A, the guiding catheter 30 is pulled back (retracted) in the proximal direction allowing the self expanding injector tubes 15 to spring open to their open position. The extent of leg expansion could be adjusted (limited and smaller) in vivo by not fully retracting the guiding catheter, thus modestly constraining the expanded dimension of the expandable tubes 15.\\n FIG. 6B is a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 after the guiding catheter has been pulled back and the inflatable balloon 16\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 has been expanded with the guide wire 20 still lying within the target vessel. From this state, the CAS 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 with expanded balloon 16\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 is advanced in the distal direction until the needles 19 penetrate the ostial wall surrounding the target vessel. Engagement of the ostial wall could be confirmed by injection of a small volume of iodinated contrast through the needles, prior to injection of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cablative\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d fluid such as alcohol.\\n FIG. 6C is a three dimensional sketch showing the CAS 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b3 now advanced in the distal direction with the injector needles 19 fully penetrating the ostial wall and the penetration limiting members (hubs) 17 on each needle limiting the penetration as they touch the ostial wall. In this configuration an ablative substance such as ethanol is injected into the ostial wall through the needles 19. The ablative fluid will disperse from the needles and as more ablative fluid is injected, the area of fluid dispersion shown in FIG. 6C will increase so as to eventually cause a complete circular ablation of tissue in the ostial wall in a ring surrounding the target vessel. The balloon 16\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 is then deflated and the CAS 10 is pulled back in the proximal direction until the needles 19 are no longer penetrating the ostial wall. The CAS 10 is then pulled back more in the proximal direction into the distal end of the guiding catheter 30 which will collapse the selfexpanding injector tubes 15. At this point the guide wire 20 may be advanced into another target vessel and the ablation procedure repeated. After the last target vessel is treated, the CAS 10 can then be removed from the patient's body. At this point electrophysiology catheters may be introduced through the guiding catheter to verify the success of the procedure.\\n FIG. 6D shows target vessel and ostial wall after the CAS 10 and guiding catheter have been removed from the body and the ablated tissue in the ostial wall remains.\\n FIG. 6E is a three dimensional sketch showing a representation of the overlapping areas of ablation in the ostial wall from each needle 19 that form a ring around the ostium of the target vessel after the procedure using the CAS 10 has been completed. While FIG. 6E shows overlapping circles to highlight the ablation from each needle 19, in reality because ethanol disperses readily in tissue, the circles would actually blend together.\\n FIG. 7  is a longitudinal cross sectional drawing of the proximal end of the present invention CAS 10. The proximal end of the inner tube 18 is attached to a Luer fitting 38 that can be used to inject fluid to flush the guide wire lumen 13 inside of the inner tube 18. The guide wire 20 is inserted through the guide wire lumen 13. The proximal end of the middle tube 14 is attached to the side tube 34 with lumen 36. The proximal end of the side tube 34 is attached to the Luer fitting 36 which can be attached to a syringe or balloon inflation device to inflate and deflate the balloon 16 of FIGS. 1 and 2 . The lumen 36 is in fluid communication with the balloon inflation lumen 24 that lies between the middle tube 14 and the inner tube 18. The proximal end of the outer tube 12 is connected to the distal end of the side tube 32 with lumen 33. The side tube 32 is connected at its proximal end to the Luer fitting 31 that can be connected to a syringe or fluid injector to inject an ablative substance such as ethanol through the lumen 33 into the injection lumen 22 through the injector tubes 15 and out the needles 19 into the ostial wall of the target vessel. Additional valves and stopcocks may also be attached to the  Luer fittings  35 and 31 as needed.\\n FIG. 8  is a longitudinal cross sectional drawing of an alternative version of the injector needle 49 of the CAS 40 with two differences from that shown in FIG. 3 . First, here the injector needle 49 is the sharpened distal end of the self-expanding tube 45 with injector tube lumen 41 while in FIG. 3  the self-expanding tube 15 was attached to a separate injector needle 19 with lumen 21. The penetration limiting means of this embodiment is the limiter 50 with tubular section 52 that is attached to the outside of the tube 45 with self-expanding  legs  57 A and 57B that will open up as the CAS 40 is deployed. The limiter 50 would typically be made from a single piece of NITINOL preset into the shape shown with at least 2 self-expanding legs. The major advantage if this design is that the penetration limiting means takes up very little space within the guiding catheter used for device delivery making it easier to slide the CAS 40 through the guiding catheter. Although two  legs  57 A and 57B are shown it is conceived that 1. 3, 4 or more legs could be attached to the tube 45 to act as a penetration limiting member or means when the needle 49 is advanced to penetrate the ostial wall of the target vessel.\\n FIG. 9  is a longitudinal cross section of the distal portion of the CAS 40 with the injector needle 49 and limiter 50 of FIG. 8  with the injector tubes 45 shown collapsed inside an insertion tube 60 with handle 65 used to insert the CAS 40 into the proximal end of a guiding catheter or sheath. This is how the CAS 40 would be typically packaged although the insertion tube 60 might be packaged proximal to the injector tubes 15 where the insertion tube 60 would be slid in the distal direction to collapse the injector tubes 15 just before the CAS 40 is inserted in the guiding catheter or sheath. Such an insertion tube 60 could be used with all of the embodiments of the present invention disclosed herein. The steps to prepare it for use would be as follows:\\n    1. Remove the sterilized CAS 40 from its packaging in a sterile field. 2. Flush the guide wire lumen 13 with saline solution. 3. Access to the left atrium via a large peripheral vein, such as the femoral vein, typically with the insertion of a sheath. 4. Use a trans septal approach to get into the left atrium, via the vein, to the right atrium, to enter the left atrium. This approach is a well known procedure. 5. Advance a guide wire and guiding catheter across the inter-atrial septum into the left atrium. 6. Using a guiding catheter or guiding sheath with a shaped distal end, engage the first targeted pulmonary vein. This can be confirmed with contrast injections as needed. 7. Advance a guide wire through the guiding catheter into the pulmonary vein. 8. Insert the proximal end of the guide wire into the guide wire lumen 13 of the CAS 40 and bring the wire through the CAS 40 and out the proximal end Luer fitting 38 of FIG. 7 . 9. Place the distal end of an insertion tube 60 which constrains the distal end of the CAS 40 into the proximal end of the guiding catheter. There is typically a TuohyBorst fitting attached to the distal end of a guiding catheter to constrain blood loss. The insertion tube 60 can be pushed through the opened Tuohy-Borst fitting and the Tuohy-Borst fitting closed on its outside to hold it in place. 10. Advance the distal end of the CAS 40 out of the insertion tube 60 and into the guiding catheter. 11. Advance the CAS 40 (or 10) through the guiding catheter 30 of FIG. 6A, and tracking over the guide wire 20, until the unexpanded tubes 45 (or 15) are located just proximal to the distal end of the guiding catheter 30. This is shown in FIG. 6A. 12. Advance the  CAS  40 or 10 over the guide wire 20 until the balloon 16 used for centering is within the target vessel. 13. Expand the balloon 16 used for centering until it is just slightly less (1-4 mm less) than the diameter of the target vessel. This will ensure that the distal portion of the  CAS  40 or 10 will be roughly \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccentered\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d within the target vessel to enable the circumferential deployment of the  expandable tubes  45 or 15 centered around the target vessel ostium so that injection into the ostial wall will be centered around the ostium of the target vessel. 14. Pull back the guiding catheter 30 so that the self-expanding injector tubes 15 open. The circumference of the tube 15 expansion can be adjusted in vivo by varying the distance of the pullback of the guiding catheter 30. That is, if one wants a smaller diameter (circumference) of expansion to fit the ostial dimension of that specific target vessel, one can partially constrain the injector tube 15 expansion by not fully retracting the guiding catheter 30 beyond the proximal end of the injector tubes 15. However, the preferred method is to have the final opening distance be preset for the  CAS  40 or 10, with the injector tubes 45 (or 15) fully expanded to their maximum diameter governed by their memory shape. Typically the  CAS  40 or 10 maximum diameter of the injector tubes 15 would be pre-selected based on the anticipated or measured diameter of the ablation ring to be created, such that the fully expanded injector tubes create the correctly sized ablation \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cring.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d This step is portrayed in FIG. 6B. 15. Advance the  CAS  40 or 10 until the injector needles in the self-expanding injector tubes 45 (or 15) penetrate the ostial wall, as seen in FIG. 6C with the penetration depth being a fixed distance limited by the penetration limiting members 17 of FIG. 6C or 50  of FIGS. 8 and 9 . 16. Attach a syringe or injection system to the Luer fitting 35 of FIG. 7 . 17. Prior to injection of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cablative\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d fluid such as alcohol engagement of the ostial wall could be confirmed by injection of a small volume of iodinated contrast via a syringe through the Luer fitting 35 and out of the  needles  49 or 19 of FIG. 6C. If there is contrast \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cstaining\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d of the tissue this will confirm that the  needles  49 or 19 are engaged into the tissue and not free floating in the left atrium or aorta. 18. Inject an appropriate volume of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) or other appropriate cytotoxic fluid from the syringe or injection system through the catheter and out of the  needles  49 or 19 into the ostial wall. A typical injection would be 1-10 ml. This should produce a multiplicity of interlocking circles of ablation (one for each needle) that will run together and intersect to form a ring or ablated tissue around the ostium of the target vessel as is seen in FIG. 6E. 19. In some cases, one may rotate the CAS 20-90 degrees and then repeat the injection to make an even more definitive ring of ablation. 20. Retract the  CAS  40 or 10 back into the guiding catheter 30 which will collapse the self-expanding  injector tubes  45 or 15. 21. The same methods as per steps 6-19 can be repeated to ablate tissue around the one or more of the other pulmonary veins during the same procedure, as indicated to ensure AF ablation or the 2nd Renal artery in the treatment of hypertension. 22. Remove the CAS 40 (or 10) from the guiding catheter 30 completely pulling it back into the insertion tube 60. Thus if the CAS 40 (or 10) needs to be put back into the body it is collapsed and ready to go. 23. When indicated, advance appropriate diagnostic electrophysiology catheters through the guiding catheter to confirm that the ablation has been successful. 24. Remove all remaining apparatus from the body.   \\nA similar approach can be used with the CAS, via access from a peripheral artery such as the femoral artery, to treat hypertension, via ablation of tissue in the periostial aortic wall tissue surrounding one or both of the renal arteries, with the goal of ablating afferent and/or efferent sympathetic nerve fibers entering or exiting the kidney.\\nWhile the proximal end of the  metallic injector tubes  15 and 45 shown here terminate in the injector manifold 11, it is also envisioned that these tubes could connect to wires that run to the proximal end of the CAS to allow the injector needles 19 and 49 to act as electrodes for sensing signals from the ostial wall of the target vessel as well as potentially delivering electrical stimulation or higher voltages and currents to ablate the tissue in the ostial wall by electrical or RF ablation.\\n FIG. 10  is a three dimensional sketch of an other embodiment of the CAS 70 that uses a balloon 76 to expand the expandable injector tubes 75 used to deliver the ablative substance to the ostial wall of the target vessel through the injection needles 79. The 8 injector tubes 75 connect to the manifold 71 that is free to slide distally and proximally along the catheter outer tube 74 as the balloon 76 is inflated and deflated. The manifold 71 connects the lumens of the injector tubes 75 to the tube 72 with fluid injection lumen 81. The tube 72 connects to a fitting at the proximal end of the CAS 70 such as the Luer fitting 33 of FIG. 7 . A source of ablative fluid would attached to the fitting and be used to inject the ablative fluid through the fluid injection lumen 81 of the tube 72 into the expandable tubes 75 and out the injection needles 79 into the ostial wall of the target vessel. The balloon 76 is inflated and deflated by delivery of a fluid through the lumen formed between the outer tube 74 and the inner tube 78. The proximal shaft 84 of the balloon 76 is attached to the outside of the outer tube 74 and the distal shaft 82 of the balloon 76 is attached to the outside of the inner tube 78. The inside of the inner tube 78 provides a guide wire lumen 85 for the guide wire 20. The distal end of the inner tube 78 includes a radiopaque marker 73 to assist in visualizing the distal end of the CAS 70 as it is inserted into the target vessel. The balloon 76 includes a distal shaft 82, a proximal shaft 84, a proximal conical section 87, a central cylindrical section 88, and a distal conical section 89. The injector tubes 74 are attached to the outside of the central cylindrical section 88 of the balloon 76 and are also held by the expandable band 77 that covers the outside of the injector tubes 75 and the central cylindrical section 88 of the balloon 76. While the expandable band 77 is shown in FIG. 10  as covering only the central cylindrical portion 88 of the balloon 76, it is envisioned that it might also extend in the proximal direction to cover the injector tubes 75 over their entire length proximal to the needles 79 which would make a smoother outer surface of the CAS 70 over this portion. The needles 79 extend in the distal direction from the distal end of the injector tubes 75 and may be made of a standard needle material such as stainless steel or a more radiopaque material such as tantalum or tungsten or plated with a radiopaque material such as gold or platinum. The expandable band 77 also serves the purpose for the CAS 70 of being the penetration limiting member located proximal to the distal end of each needle 70 that only allows each needle 70 to penetrate a preset distance into the ostial wall of the target vessel. In this embodiment the penetration limiting member 77 should limit needle penetration to a depth between 0.5 mm and 1 em, It is also envisioned that the entire CAS 70 could be covered by a sheath (not shown) that would protect the needles 79 from coming into contact with the inside of the guiding catheter used to delivery the CAS 70 to the target vessel. The sheath would be slid back in the proximal direction once the CAS 70 is positioned with the guide wire 20 within the target vessel. The CAS 70 can also be used with an insertion tube 60 as shown in FIG. 9 .\\nThe balloon 76 can be either an elastic balloon or a semi-compliant or non-compliant balloon such as used in angioplasty catheters. Such a balloon is typically inflated with normal saline solution including a contrast agent.\\nIt is also envisioned that the best way to protect the needles 79 of the CAS 70 would be to have an elastic band (not shown in FIG. 10 ) attached to the distal shaft of the balloon 82 or the inner tube 78 (or both) cover the distal ends of the needles 79 in the pre-deployment condition. Inflation of the Balloon 76 would pull the needles 79 in the proximal direction out from under such an elastic band. Such an elastic band would prevent the needles 79 from catching on the inside of the guiding catheter as the CAS 70 is advanced into the body.\\nFor this embodiment of the CAS 70, the method of use would be the following steps:\\n1. Remove the sterilized CAS 70 from its packaging in a sterile field.\\n2. Flush the guide wire lumen 85 with saline solution.\\nAccess to the left atrium via a large peripheral vein, such as the femoral vein, typically with the insertion of a sheath.\\nUse a trans septal approach to get into the left atrium, via the vein, to the right atrium, to enter the left atrium. This approach is a well known procedure.\\nAdvance a guide wire and guiding catheter across the inter-atrial septum into the left atrium.\\nUsing a guiding catheter or guiding sheath with a shaped distal end, engage the first targeted pulmonary vein. This can be confirmed with contrast injections as needed.\\nAdvance a guide wire through the guiding catheter into the pulmonary vein.\\nInsert the proximal end of the guide wire 20 into the guide wire lumen 85 of the CAS and bring the wire 20 through the CAS 70 and out the proximal end Luer fitting 38 of FIG. 7 .\\nPlace the distal end of an insertion tube 60 of FIG. 9  which constrains the distal end of the CAS 70 into the proximal end of the guiding catheter. There is typically a Tuohy-Borst fitting attached to the distal end of a guiding catheter to constrain blood loss. The insertion tube 60 can be pushed through the opened Tuohy-Borst fitting and the Tuohy-Borst fitting closed on its outside to hole it in place.\\nAdvance the distal end of the CAS 70 out of the insertion tube 60 and into the guiding catheter.\\nAdvance the CAS 70 through the guiding catheter, and tracking over the guide wire 20, until the distal marker band 73 is located just proximal to the distal end of the guiding catheter.\\nAdvance the CAS 70 over the guide wire 20 until the marker band 73 is within the target vessel and the distal shaft 82 of the balloon 76 is just proximal to the target vessel.\\nPull the guiding catheter back so that the balloon 76 is now distal to the distal end of the guiding catheter.\\nInflate the balloon 76 until it is the appropriate diameter which is between 1 and 10 mm larger in diameter than the target vessel.\\nAdvance the CAS until the injector needles in the injector tubes 75 penetrate the ostial wall, with the penetration depth being a fixed distance limited by the expandable band 77. The distal conical section of the balloon 76 will act to center the CAS 70 as it is advanced into the target vessel.\\nAttach a syringe or injection system to the Luer fitting 35 of FIG. 7  that provides ablative fluid that will be injected into the ostial wall.\\nEngagement of the ostial wall could be confirmed by injection of a small volume of iodinated contrast via a syringe through the Luer fitting 35 and out of the needles 79 prior to injection of an \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cablative\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d fluid such as alcohol. If there is contrast \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cstaining\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d of the tissue this will confirm that the needles 79 are engaged into the tissue and not free floating in the left atrium or aorta.\\nInject an appropriate volume of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) or other appropriate cytotoxic fluid from the syringe or injection system through the lumen 81 of the tube 82 and out of the needles 79 into the ostial wall. A typical injection would be 1-10 ml. This should produce a multiplicity of interlocking circles of ablation (one for each needle) that should intersect to form a ring around the ostium of the target vessel as is seen in FIG. 6E.\\nDeflate the balloon 76 and retract the CAS 70 back into the guiding catheter.\\nIn some cases, one may rotate the CAS 70 between 20-90 degrees and then repeat the injection to make an even more definitive ring of ablation.\\nThe same methods as per steps 6-20 can be repeated to ablate tissue around the one or more of the other pulmonary veins during the same procedure, as indicated to ensure AF ablation or the 2nd Renal artery in the treatment of hypertension.\\nRemove the CAS 70 from the guiding catheter completely pulling it back into the insertion tube 60. Thus if the CAS 70 needs to be put back into the body it is collapsed and ready to go.\\nWhen indicated, advance appropriate diagnostic electrophysiology catheters through the guiding catheter to confirm that the ablation has been successful.\\nRemove all remaining apparatus from the body.\\nA similar approach can be used with the CAS 70, via access from a peripheral artery such as the femoral artery, to treat hypertension, via ablation of tissue in the periostial aortic wall tissue surrounding one or both of the renal arteries, with the goal of ablating afferent and/or efferent sympathetic nerve fibers entering or exiting the kidney.\\nWhile the CAS 70 shows a separate tube 72 it is envisioned the fluid injection lumen of the CAS 70 catheter body could be constructed similar to that of the CAS 10 of FIGS. 1-5  where an additional outer tube would be placed with the fluid injection lumen being between the outer and middle tubes. It is also envisioned that instead of concentric tubes with lumens between the tubes, a multi-lumen catheter could be used with separate lumens formed during extrusion of the catheter body. Similarly, while the shape of the tubes and lumens shown here are cylindrical, other shapes are also envisioned.\\nWhile the present invention described here has an expandable balloon as a centering means, it is envisioned that a fixed diameter centering section could be used or a mechanical expandable structure could also facilitate centering of the CAS. While the version of the CAS shown here is an over the wire design, it is also envisioned that a rapid exchange guide wire system where the wire exits the catheter body at a location between the proximal end and the fluid injection ring would be feasible here. In addition, a fixed wire design such as that shown by Fischell et al in U.S. Pat. No. 6,375,660 for a stent delivery catheter would also work here.\\nVarious other modifications, adaptations, and alternative designs are of course possible in light of the above teachings. Therefore, it should be understood at this time that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.\\n\",\n          \"\\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\\nThis is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

Nothing contained herein is to be construed as an \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cadmission\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d of prior art. Applicant expressly reserves the right to demonstrate, where appropriate, that the articles and methods referenced herein do not constitute prior art under the applicable statutory provisions.\\nComprehensive gene expression analysis and protein analysis have been useful tools in understanding mechanisms of biology. Use of these tools has allowed the identification of genes and proteins involved in development and in various diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disease. Conventional methods such as in situ hybridization and other multiplexed detection of different transcripts have revealed spatial patterns of gene expression and have helped shed light on the molecular basis of development and disease. Other technologies that have enabled the quantitative analysis of many RNA sequences per sample include microarrays (see Shi, et al., Nature Biotechnology, 24(9):1151-61 (2006); and Slonim and Yanai, Plos Computational Biology, 5(10):e1000543 (2009)); serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (see Velculescu, et al, Science, 270(5235):484-87 (1995)), high-throughput implementations of qPCR (see Spurgeon, et al., Plos ONE, 3(2):e1662 (2008)) and in situ PCR (see Nuovo, Genome Res., 4:151-67 (1995)). As useful as these methods are, however, they do not enable simultaneous measurement of the expression of many genes or the presence and/or activity of multiple proteins at many spatial locations in a sample. Laser capture microdissection has permitted the analysis of many genes at a small number of locations, but it is very expensive, laborious, and does not scale well. Certain PCR assays in a 2D format preserve spatial information (see Armani, et al., Lab on a Chip, 9(24): 3526-34 (2009)), but these methods have low spatial resolution because they rely on physical transference of tissue into wells, which also prevents random access to tissue samples and high levels of multiplexing.\\nAt present, no practical method exists to analyze at high resolution the spatial expression patterns of large numbers of genes, proteins, or other biologically active molecules simultaneously. There is thus a need for reproducible, high-resolution spatial maps of biological molecules in tissues. The present invention addresses this need.\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\\nThis Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other features, details, utilities, and advantages of the claimed subject matter will be apparent from the following written Detailed Description including those aspects illustrated in the accompanying drawings and defined in the appended claims.\\nThe invention encompasses assay systems that provide high-resolution spatial maps of biological activity in tissues. The assay system comprises an assay capable of high levels of multiplexing where encoded probes are provided to a biological sample in defined spatial patterns; instrumentation capable of controlled delivery of reagents according to the spatial patterns; and a decoding scheme providing a readout that is digital in nature. In short, the present invention provides the ability to look at many biological targets in many locations, providing the resolution of in situ hybridization with the highly-parallel data analysis of sequencing.\\nThus, in some embodiments, the invention provides an assay system to determine spatial patterns of abundance or activity or both of multiple biological targets at multiple sites in a sample, where the assay system performs the following steps: providing a sample affixed to a support; delivering encoded probes for the multiple biological targets to the multiple sites in the sample in a known spatial pattern, where each encoded probe comprises a probe region that may interact with the biological targets and a coding tag that identifies a location of the site to which the encoded probe was delivered; allowing the encoded probes to interact with the biological targets; separating encoded probes that interact with the biological targets from encoded probes that do not interact with the biological targets; determining all or a portion of a sequence of the encoded probes, and associating the abundance or activity or both of the multiple biological targets to the locations of the sites in the sample.\\nIn particular aspects of the invention the biological targets comprise nucleic acids and the encoded probes are oligonucleotides, and in some aspects, there are two encoded probes for each of the multiple nucleic acid targets. In some aspects, the multiple biological targets comprise proteins, the probe regions of the encoding probes are proteins and the coding tags comprise oligonucleotides. In some aspects the multiple biological targets comprise enzymes. In some aspects the probe regions of the encoded probes comprise antibodies, aptamers or small molecules.\\nSome aspects of the assay system further comprise an amplification step between the separating step and the determining step. In some aspects, the determining step is performed by nucleic acid sequencing, and in preferred aspects, the sequencing is high-throughput digital nucleic acid sequencing.\\nIn some aspects of the invention, the product of the multiple biological targets being assayed and the multiple sites in the sample is greater than 20, in some aspects product of the multiple biological targets being assayed and the multiple sites in the sample is greater than 50, in some aspects the product of the multiple biological targets being assayed and the multiple sites in the sample is greater than 75, 100, 150, 500, 750, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, or 1,000,000 or more. In other aspects, the sequence of at least fifty thousand encoding probes are determined in parallel, in other aspects the sequence of at least one hundred thousand encoding probes are determined in parallel, in some aspects the sequence of at least five hundred thousand encoding probes are determined in parallel, and in some aspects the sequence of at least one million, ten million, one hundred million, one billion, ten billion, one hundred billion or more encoding probes are determined in parallel.\\nIn some aspects, the known spatial pattern is determined by histological features of the sample. Also in some aspects, software programmed hardware performs at least two steps of the delivering step, the separation step, the determining step and the associating step.\\nIn some aspects, the probe regions of the encoded probes are proteins and the separating step is accomplished by encoded probes that interact with the biological targets being captured by an affinity capture agent. In some aspects the probe regions of the encoding probes are nucleic acids and the separating step is accomplished by a washing of the sample.\\nIn other embodiments there is provided an assay system to determine spatial patterns of abundance or activity or both of multiple nucleic acid targets at multiple sites in a sample, where the assay system performs the following steps: providing a sample affixed to a support; delivering oligonucleotide probes for multiple nucleic acid targets to the multiple sites in the sample in a known spatial pattern; allowing the oligonucleotide probes to hybridize with the nucleic acid targets; washing unhybridized encoded oligonucleotide probes from the sample; delivering one or more encoding agents to locations of the multiple sites in the sample according to a known spatial pattern, where the combination of encoding agents delivered to each site is different; coupling the encoding agents and the oligonucleotide probes to form encoded probes; determining all or a portion of a sequence of the encoded probes using high-throughput sequencing, and associating the abundance or activity or both of multiple biological targets to the locations of multiple sites in the sample.\\nOther embodiments of the invention provide an assay system to determine spatial patterns of abundance or activity or both of multiple protein targets at multiple sites in a sample, where the assay system performs the following steps: providing a sample affixed to a support; delivering encoded probes for the multiple protein targets to the multiple sites in the sample in a known spatial pattern, where each encoded probe comprises a protein probe region that may interact with the protein targets and a coding tag that identifies a location of the site to which the encoded probe was delivered and the protein probe region of the encoding probe of which the coding tag is part; allowing the encoded probes to interact with the protein targets; separating encoded probes that interact with the protein targets from encoded probes that do not interact with the protein targets; determining all or a portion of a sequence of the encoded probes by high throughput sequencing, and associating the abundance or activity or both of the multiple protein targets to the locations of the multiple sites in the sample.\\nOther embodiments provide an assay system to determine spatial patterns of abundance or activity or both of multiple biological targets at multiple sites in a sample, where the assay system performs the following steps: providing a sample affixed to a support; delivering encoded probes for the multiple biological targets to the multiple sites in the sample in a known spatial pattern, where each encoded probe comprises a probe region that may interact with the biological targets and a coding tag that identifies a location of the site to which the encoded probe was delivered and identifies the biological target; allowing the encoded probes to interact with the biological targets; determining all or a portion of a sequence of the encoded probes, and associating the abundance or activity or both of the multiple biological targets to the locations of the sites in the sample.\\nThe assay system of the invention can utilize various detection mechanisms, based on the molecules to be detected and the reagents needed for such detection system. Exemplary methods that can be used with the assay systems of the invention are described in more detail below.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\\n FIG. 1 provides a simplified overview of the assay system of the present invention.\\n FIG. 2 provides a simplified overview of one embodiment of the assay system of the present invention for detecting nucleic acids.\\n FIG. 3 is a representational depiction of one embodiment of the assay overviewed in FIG. 2.\\n FIG. 4A-C illustrates a general mechanism for one embodiment of a combinatorial encoding scheme of the assay systems of the invention.

FIG. 4C shows a tissue section sample to which the coding tags are delivered, forming the coding tag grid in the sample.\\n FIG. 5 provides a simplified, specific example of the embodiment of a combinatorial encoding scheme shown in FIG. 4.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS\\nThe terms used herein are intended to have the plain and ordinary meaning as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The following definitions are intended to aid the reader in understanding the present invention, but are not intended to vary or otherwise limit the meaning of such terms unless specifically indicated.\\nThe term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cantibody\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d as used herein is intended to refer to an entire immunoglobulin or antibody or any functional fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule which is capable of specific binding to an antigen (antibodies and antigens are \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cbinding partners\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d as defined herein). \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cAntibody\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d as used herein is meant to include the entire antibody as well as any antibody fragments capable of binding the antigen or antigenic fragment of interest. Examples of such peptides include complete antibody molecules, antibody fragments, such as Fab, F(ab\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2)2, CDRS, VL, VH, and any other portion of an antibody which is capable of specifically binding to an antigen. Antibodies for assays of the invention are immunoreactive or immunospecific for, and therefore specifically and selectively bind to, proteins either detected (i.e., biological targets) or used for detection (i.e., probes) in the assays of the invention.\\nThe term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cbinding agent\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d as used herein refers to any agent that specifically binds to a biological molecule of interest\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cComplementary\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009csubstantially complementary\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d refers to the hybridization or base pairing or the formation of a duplex between nucleotides or nucleic acids, such as, for instance, between the two strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule or between an oligonucleotide primer and a primer binding site on a single-stranded nucleic acid. Complementary nucleotides are, generally, A and T (or A and U), or C and G. Two single-stranded RNA or DNA molecules are said to be substantially complementary when the nucleotides of one strand, optimally aligned and compared and with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions, pair with at least about 80% of the other strand, usually at least about 90% to about 95%, and even about 98% to about 100%).\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHybridization\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d refers to the process in which two single-stranded polynucleotides bind non-covalently to form a stable double-stranded polynucleotide, The resulting (usually) double-stranded polynucleotide is a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009chybrid\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cduplex,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHybridization conditions\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d will typically include salt concentrations of approximately less than 1M, often less than about 500 mM and may be less than about 200 mM. A \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009chybridization buffer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is a buffered salt solution such as 5% SSPE, or other such buffers known in the art. Hybridization temperatures can be as low as 5\\u00c2\\u00b0 C., but are typically greater than 22\\u00c2\\u00b0 C., and more typically greater than about 30\\u00c2\\u00b0 C., and typically in excess of 37\\u00c2\\u00b0 C. Hybridizations are often performed under stringent conditions, i.e., conditions under which a primer will hybridize to its target subsequence but will not hybridize to the other, non-complementary sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and are different in different circumstances. For example, longer fragments may require higher hybridization temperatures for specific hybridization than short fragments. As other factors may affect the stringency of hybridization, including base composition and length of the complementary strands, presence of organic solvents, and the extent of base mismatching, the combination of parameters is more important than the absolute measure of any one parameter alone. Generally stringent conditions are selected to be about 5\\u00c2\\u00b0 C. lower than the Tm for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. Exemplary stringent conditions include a salt concentration of at least 0.01 M to no more than 1M sodium ion concentration (or other salt) at a pH of about 7.0 to about 8.3 and a temperature of at least 25\\u00c2\\u00b0 C. For example, conditions of 5\\u00c3\\u0097SSPE (750 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA at pH 7.4) and a temperature of approximately 30\\u00c2\\u00b0 C. are suitable for allele-specific hybridizations, though a suitable temperature depends on the length and/or GC content of the region hybridized.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLigation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d means to form a covalent bond or linkage between the termini of two or more nucleic acids, e.g., oligonucleotides and/or polynucleotides, in a template-driven reaction. The nature of the bond or linkage may vary widely and the ligation may be carried out enzymatically or chemically. As used herein, ligations are usually carried out enzymatically to form a phosphodiester linkage between a 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 carbon terminal nucleotide of one oligonucleotide with a 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 carbon of another nucleotide.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cNucleic acid\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009coligonucleotide\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009coligo\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d or grammatical equivalents used herein refers generally to at least two nucleotides covalently linked together. A nucleic acid generally will contain phosphodiester bonds, although in some cases nucleic acid analogs may be included that have alternative backbones such as phosphoramidite, phosphorodithioate, or methylphophoroamidite linkages; or peptide nucleic acid backbones and linkages. Other analog nucleic acids include those with bicyclic structures including locked nucleic acids, positive backbones, non-ionic backbones and non-ribose backbones. Modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to increase the stability of the molecules; for example, PNA:DNA hybrids can exhibit higher stability in some environments.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cPrimer\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d means an oligonucleotide, either natural or synthetic, that is capable, upon forming a duplex with a polynucleotide template, of acting as a point of initiation of nucleic acid synthesis and being extended from its 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 end along the template so that an extended duplex is formed. The sequence of nucleotides added during the extension process is determined by the sequence of the template polynucleotide. Primers usually are extended by a DNA polymerase.\\nThe term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSNP\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009csingle nucleotide polymorphism\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d refers to a genetic variation between individuals; e.g., a single nitrogenous base position in the DNA of organisms that is variable. SNPs are found across the genome; much of the genetic variation between individuals is due to variation at SNP loci, and often this genetic variation results in phenotypic variation between individuals. SNPs for use in the present invention and their respective alleles may be derived from any number of sources, such as public databases (U.C. Santa Cruz Human Genome Browser Gateway (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) or the NCBI db SNP website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), or may be experimentally determined as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,969,589; and US Pub. No. 2006/0188875 entitled \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHuman Genomic Polymorphisms.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Although the use of SNPs is described in some of the embodiments presented herein, it will be understood that other biallelic or multi-allelic genetic markers may also be used. A biallelic genetic marker is one that has two polymorphic forms, or alleles. As mentioned above, for a biallelic genetic marker that is associated with a trait, the allele that is more abundant in the genetic composition of a case group as compared to a control group is termed the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cassociated allele,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and the other allele may be referred to as the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cunassociated allele.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Thus, for each biallelic polymorphism that is associated with a given trait (e.g., a disease or drug response), there is a corresponding associated allele. Other biallelic polymorphisms that may be used with the methods presented herein include, but are not limited to multinucleotide changes, insertions, deletions, and translocations. It will be further appreciated that references to DNA herein may include genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA, episomal DNA, and/or derivatives of DNA such as amplicons, RNA transcripts, cDNA, DNA analogs, etc. The polymorphic loci that are screened in an association study may be in a diploid or a haploid state and, ideally, would be from sites across the genome.\\nThe term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cselectively binds\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cselective binding\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and the like as used herein, when referring to a binding partner (e.g., protein, nucleic acid, antibody or other affinity capture agent, etc.), refers to a binding reaction of two or more binding partners with high affinity and/or complementarity to ensure selective hybridization under designated assay conditions. Typically, specific binding will be at least three times the standard deviation of the background signal. Thus, under designated conditions the binding partner binds to its particular \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ctarget\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d molecule and does not bind in a significant amount to other molecules present in the sample.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSequencing\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009csequence determination\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and the like means determination of information relating to the nucleotide base sequence of a nucleic acid. Such information may include the identification or determination of partial as well as full sequence information of the nucleic acid. Sequence information may be determined \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwith varying degrees of statistical reliability or confidence. In one aspect, the term includes the determination of the identity and ordering of a plurality of contiguous nucleotides in a nucleic acid, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHigh throughput digital sequencing\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnext generation sequencing\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d means sequence determination using methods that determine many (typically thousands to billions) of nucleic acid sequences in an intrinsically parallel manner, i.e. where DNA templates are prepared for sequencing not one at a time, but in a bulk process, and where many sequences are read out preferably in parallel, or alternatively using an ultra-high throughput serial process that itself may be parallelized. Such methods include but are not limited to pyrosequencing (for example, as commercialized by 454 Life Sciences, Inc., Branford, Conn.); sequencing by ligation (for example, as commercialized in the SOLiD\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 technology, Life Technology, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.); sequencing by synthesis using modified nucleotides (such as commercialized in TruSee\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 and HiSeq\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 technology by Illumina, Inc., San Diego, Calif., HeliScope\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 by Helicos Biosciences Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., and PacBio RS by Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., Menlo Park, Calif.), sequencing by ion detection technologies (Ion Torrent, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.); sequencing of DNA nanoballs (Complete Genomics, Inc., Mountain View, Calif.); nanopore-based sequencing technologies (for example, as developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, LTD, Oxford, UK), and like highly parallelized sequencing methods.\\nThe term \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is used in reference to the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cmelting temperature.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. Several equations for calculating the Tm of nucleic acids are well known in the art. As indicated by standard references, a simple estimate of the Tm value may be calculated by the equation, Tm=81.5+0.41 (% G+C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1M NaCl (see e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization (1985)). Other references (e.g., Allawi and SantaLucia, Jr., Biochemistry, 36:10581-94 (1997)) include alternative methods of computation which take structural and environmental, as well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of Tm.\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\\nThe practice of the techniques described herein may employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques and descriptions of organic chemistry, polymer technology, molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), cell biology, biochemistry, and sequencing technology, which are within the skill of those who practice in the art. Such conventional techniques include polymer array synthesis, hybridization and ligation of polynucleotides, and detection of hybridization using a label. Specific illustrations of suitable techniques can be had by reference to the examples herein. However, other equivalent conventional procedures can, of course, also be used. Such conventional techniques and descriptions can be found in standard laboratory manuals such as Green, et al., Eds., Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual Series (Vols.

The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges, and are also encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either both of those included limits are also included in the invention,\\nIn the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a more thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without one or more of these specific details. In other instances, well-known features and procedures well known to those skilled in the art have not been described in order to avoid obscuring the invention.\\nThe Invention in General\\nThe assay systems of the invention provide spatially-encoded, multiplexed assays comprising 1) an assay capable of high levels of multiplexing with an efficient spatial encoding scheme; 2) instrumentation capable of delivering reagents according to a spatial pattern; and 3) decoding determined by a readout that is digital in nature. The assay systems of the invention detect the presence or absence and relative amount of a biological target or biological activity indicative of a biological target, as well as the location of the biological target or activity in a biological sample, e.g., a tissue section or other biological structure disposed upon a support such as a microscope slide or culture dish.\\nThe assay system further provides instrumentation with an ability to deliver reagents in a spatially-defined pattern. This instrumentation, together \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwith software, reagents and protocols, provides a key component of the highly innovative assay system of the invention, allowing for measurement of numerous biological targets or activities in a meaningful spatial environment, including gene expression and peptide localization, An encoding scheme used in these assay systems allows one to determine the location of biological targets or activity (or lack thereof) in the biological samples after the products of the multiplexed assay are removed from the biological sample and pooled for analysis. Decoding of the encoding scheme can be performed by, e.g., next-generation sequencing, which easily provides millions to trillions of data points at low cost. The assay results such as the amount or activity of biological targets can then be mapped back to specific location in the biological sample. The assay systems open a new analytical window into the complex spatial patterns of cellular function and regulation in biological samples.\\nA simplified overview of the assay system 100 of the present invention is provided at FIG. 1, At step 110, a biological sample affixed to a support is provided. The biological sample contains biological targets of interest. Biological targets can include any molecule of interest, such as nucleic acids (including, e.g, RNA transcripts, genomic DNA sequences, cDNAs, amplicons, or other nucleic acid sequences) and proteins, enzymes and the like. At step 120, encoded probes are delivered to the biological sample according to a known spatial pattern. Encoded probes comprise probes, which can interact \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwith biological targets of interest, and coding tags, which identify the positions in the sample of the biological targets being assayed, and thus can be used to link assay results back to locations in the sample. Coding tags in most embodiments are oligonucleotides. However, coding tags may also be mass tags, fluorescent labels, or other moieties.\\nIn some embodiments, the probe and coding tag portions of the encoded probe are pre-coupled before being delivered to the biological sample, For example, in the case where the encoded probes are oligonucleotides, both the probe and coding tag sequence can be synthesized as a single oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the probe and coding tag portions of the encoding probes can be synthesized or obtained separately and combined before delivery to the biological sample (e.g., two separate oligonucleotides can be synthesized and coupled by, e.g., ligation; or an antibody and an oligonucleotide can be prepared separately and conjugated before delivery to the biological sample). Also, as is described in FIGS. 2-5, the probes and the coding tags (in encoding oligonucleotides) are synthesized separately, and are delivered to the biological sample at different steps (e.g., probes first and coding tags thereafter, or vice versa) in the assay.\\nAt step 130, the encoded probes are allowed to react or interact with the biological targets, i.e., conditions are provided to allow e.g., oligonucleotides to hybridize to nucleic acid targets, enzymes to catalyze reactions with protein targets, antibodies to bind epitopes, etc. In the case where the biological targets are nucleic acids, the encoded probes are typically oligonucleotides and hybridize to the target nucleic acids. In the case that the biological targets are proteins, the encoded probes typically are aptamers, small molecules, or oligonucleotide-conjugated proteins that interact with target proteins by binding to them or by reacting with them (that is, one of the proteins is a substrate for the other). Encoding oligonucleotides may be coupled to the probes (proteins) by conjugation, chemical or photo-crosslinking via suitable groups and the like.\\nOnce encoded probes interact with the biological targets, the encoded probes that interacted with the biological targets must be separated from the encoded probes that did not interact with the biological targets at step 140. In the case where the biological targets are nucleic acids and the encoded probes are oligonucleotides, the separation can be accomplished by, e.g., washing the unhybridized encoded probes from the sample. Similarly, for other assays that are based on affinity binding, including those using aptamer, small molecule, and protein probes, washing steps can be used to remove low affinity binders. In the case where the probe is transformed via interaction with the target, e.g., in the case of a peptide, e.g., via cleavage by a protease or phosphorylation by a kinase, it is convenient to collect, all encoded probes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094both encoded probes that interacted with the biological targets and were transformed and encoded probes that were not transformed. After collection or pooling, an antibody or other affinity capture agent can be used to capture probes that were transformed by addition of a moiety (e.g., a phosphate group). In cases where probes have been transformed via cleavage, the transformed probes can be separated, e.g., by capturing the non-transformed probes via a tag that is removed from the transformed probes during the transformation (e.g., by cleavage), or by adding a new tag at the site of cleavage.\\nOnce the reacted (transformed) or interacted encoded probes are separated from the unreacted or un-interacted encoded probes, the sequence of the reacted and/or interacted encoded probes is determined at step 150 by, preferably, sequencing. The sequence of the encoded probes allows the mapping of the assay results at step 160 back to locations in the biological sample.\\n FIG. 2 provides a simplified overview of an assay system 200 of the present invention embodying an efficient implementation of a combinatorial coding scheme for the encoding of spatial information. For purposes of this overview, the probes are oligonucleotides, but as explained elsewhere, other types of probes can also be used. In step 210, a biological sample affixed to a support, e.g., a tissue sample or other biological structure, is provided. In step 220, one or more oligonucleotide probes are delivered to the biological sample, where the oligonucleotide probes are capable of hybridizing with biological targets in the biological sample. In step 230, the oligonucleotide probes are allowed to interact with (hybridize to) the nucleic acid targets; that is, appropriate conditions are provided where oligonucleotide probes can hybridize to the target nucleic acids.\\nIn step 240, the oligonucleotide probes that did not hybridize to target nucleic acids are removed, and thereby separated from oligonucleotide probes that did hybridize to target nucleic acids. In this embodiment, separation can be accomplished by, e.g., washing the sample to remove unhybridized oligonucleotide probes. Next, in step 250, encoding oligonucleotides (the encoding agents) are delivered to the biological sample according to a chosen spatial pattern, where the encoding oligonucleotides comprise coding tags that are used to encode the location of biological targets in the biological sample. Note that in contrast to the assay system of FIG. 1, here the probes and encoding agents (encoding oligonucleotides) are delivered in separate steps. In step 260, the encoding oligonucleotides are coupled to the oligonucleotide probes to create encoded probes. In this case where the probes are oligonucleotides, the encoding oligonucleotides may be coupled to the oligonucleotides probes by, e.g., ligation. Alternatively, the information in the encoding oligonucleotides can be transferred by using a DNA polymerase to extend a probe oligonucleotide that acts as a primer, and thereby copy and incorporate the sequence of the encoding oligonucleotides.\\nIn step 270, the sequence of the coding tags in the encoded probes as well as the sequence or a portion of the sequence of the probe itself is determined, and in step 280, the target nucleic acids are mapped back to the biological sample. In some embodiments, the abundance of sequences reveals the relative quantity of biological targets at the location. Although this embodiment shows the individual steps in a particular order, so as to better explain the invention, the precise order of the steps can be varied. For example, steps 220 and 250 can be combined, so that a mixture of the probes and encoding oligonucleotides is delivered according to a chosen spatial pattern. Coupling step 260 can then be carried out immediately after the combined  steps  220 and 250, or concomitantly with them. In this case, step 240 would then occur after step 260. It can therefore be appreciated that the two key results of this series of steps, i.e., the location-specific encoding of probe molecules and the separation of probe molecules based on their ability to interact with corresponding target molecules, can be accomplished with some flexibility in the implementation of the particular steps. Similarly, there is considerable flexibility in the design of the coding scheme. As described infra, the assays of the invention are particularly amenable to combinatorial methods.\\nThus, the present invention provides an ability to look at many different biological targets in many locations, providing the resolution of in situ hybridization with the highly-parallel data analysis of sequencing. In some embodiments, the sum of the multiple biological targets being assayed and the multiple sites in the biological sample is greater than 20, in other embodiments, the sum of the multiple biological targets being assayed and the multiple sites in the biological sample is greater than 50, in other embodiments, the sum of the multiple biological targets being assayed and the multiple sites in the biological sample is greater than 100, greater than 500, 1,000, 10,000, 25,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000. It will be appreciated that, due to the spatial encoding dimension of the invention, even much larger numbers can be contemplated. For example, assaying 10,000 targets per location\\u00c3\\u009710,000 locations would generate 108 different assays, and even larger numbers than these can easily be contemplated, particularly if spatial locations with resolution on the order of that of single cells are utilized. Further, in embodiments where high-throughput digital sequencing is employed, the sequences of at least 1,000 encoding probes are typically determined in parallel. More typically, using a digital readout, it is desirable to obtain multiple sequence reads for each assay (defined by a probe and a spatial location code). It is desirable to obtain an average of at least 3 copies per assay, and more typically at least 10 or at least 30 copies per assay, depending on the design of the experiment and requirements of the assay. For a quantitative readout with suitable dynamic range, it may be desirable to obtain at least 1,000 reads per assay. Therefore, if 1,000,000 assays are carried out, the number of sequence reads may be 1 billion or more. With high-throughput digital sequencing, and allowing for redundancy, the sequence of at least 10,000 encoding probes are determined in parallel, or the sequence of at least 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 100,000,000, 1,000,000,000 or more encoding probes are determined in parallel.\\nAssays\\nThe assay portion of the assay systems of the present invention comprise the following general steps: delivering probes and encoding agents where the encoding agents (in some embodiments pre-coupled to the probes) are delivered to the sample according to a known spatial pattern, allowing the probes to interact or react with biological targets in the sample, and, if the probes and encoding agents have not been pre-coupled, coupling the encoding agents to probes.\\nThe samples of the present invention include virtually any biological sample or samples that can be affixed to a support or provided essentially in a two-dimensional manner, where the ability to tie an assayed biological target or activity back to the location within the biological sample is important. Exemplary biological samples include tissue sections (e.g., including whole animal sectioning and tissue biopsies), cell populations on slides or culture dishes, and the like. The assay systems of the invention are particularly advantageous in that they are compatible with numerous biological sample types, including fresh samples, such as primary tissue sections, and preserved samples including but not limited to frozen samples and paraformalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. An important aspect of the assay systems of the invention is that the biological samples are immobilized on a substrate surface having discrete, independently measurable areas.\\nThe biological targets to be detected can be any biological molecules including but not limited to proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, ions, or multicomponent complexes containing any of the above. Examples of subcellular targets include organelles, e.g., mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, chloroplasts, endocytic vesicles, exocytic vesicles, vacuoles, lysosomes, etc.\\nIn some particular embodiments, the assay system is used to analyze nucleic acids, e.g., by genotyping, quantitation of DNA copy number or RNA transcripts, localization of particular transcripts within samples, and the like. FIG. 3 illustrates an overall scheme for an exemplary assay for, e.g., detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can be used with the assay system of the invention. In FIG. 3, two oligonucleotide probes are provided. Each oligonucleotide probe comprises a target-specific region (located on either side of the SNP to be analyzed) seen at 305 and 307, and ligation regions, seen at 301 and 303, The oligonucleotide probes are allowed to hybridize to a target nucleic acid (not shown) in the biological sample. At step 302, one of the oligonucleotide probes is extended to incorporate the SNP sequence and ligated to the other probe to form an extended probe comprising target nucleic acid region 309 and  ligation regions  301 and 303.\\nTwo encoding agents, both comprising a coding tag (seen at 315 and 317), a ligation region (seen at 311 and 313), and a primer region (seen at 319 and 321) are combined with and ligated to the extended probe at step 304 to form an encoded target-specific oligonucleotide. Again, in contrast with FIG. 1, the probes and encoding agents are delivered at separate steps. Doing so allows use of the combinatorial embodiments described infra. In preferred embodiments, the encoding oligonucleotides within a pair of encoding oligonucleotides ligate specifically to one side of the target sequence or the other (i.e., 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 or 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 of the target sequence) in step 306. Also, typically, the ligation and primer regions of the encoding oligonucleotides and probes are universal; that is, the set of ligation and primer regions used in constructing the probes and encoding oligonucleotides are constant, and only the target-specific regions of the probes and the coding tags of the encoding oligonucleotides differ. However, again in alternative embodiments, the ligation and primer regions are not universal and differ between probes and encoding agents.\\nFollowing ligation, the encoded probes are eluted, pooled, and, optionally, sequencing adapters are added to the encoded probes via PCR. In alternative embodiments, sequencing primers may be ligated to the encoding oligonucleotides, or sequencing primer sequences can be included as part of the encoding oligonucleotide. As seen in FIG. 3, each sequencing adapter comprises  primer region  319 or 321, compatible with the  primer regions  319 and 321 on the encoded probes. The final construct comprising first adapter 327, first primer region 319, first coding tag 315,  ligation regions  311 and 301, target region 309,  ligation regions  313 and 303, second coding tag 317, second primer region 325 and second adapter 329 is now ready for input into a digital high-throughput sequencing process.\\nA combination of extension and ligation reactions are exemplified in FIG. 3, but it should be appreciated that a variety of reactions may be used to couple the encoding oligonucleotides to the target-specific oligonucleotides, including ligation only (e.g., for oligonucleotides that hybridize to contiguous portions of the target nucleic acid sequence). Alternatively, an assay utilizing an additional oligonucleotide, such as in the GOLDENGATE\\u00c2\\u00ae assay (see Fan, et al., Cold Spring Symp. Quant. Biol., 68:69-78 (2003); (Ilumina, Inc., San Diego, Calif.)), may be employed.\\nIn other embodiments, the assay system of the invention also can be used to analyze peptides or proteins, the presence of antibodies, enzymatic and other protein activities, posttranslational modifications, active and non-active forms of peptides, as well as peptide isoforms in a biological sample. Accordingly, the probes may comprise an active region of an enzyme, a binding domain of an immunoglobulin, defined domains of proteins, whole proteins, synthetic peptides, peptides with introduced mutations, aptamers and the like.\\nIn certain aspects, the probes are substrates for enzymes or proenzymes, e.g., kinases, phosphatases, zymogens, proteases, or fragments thereof. In certain aspects, the probes are phosphorylation substrates used to detect proteins involved in one or more signal transduction pathways, e.g., a kinase or a phosphatase. In another specific aspect of the invention, the probes are specific protease substrates that associate only with individual proteases or classes of proteases. In other aspects, the probes are different processed forms, isoforms and/or domains of an enzyme. Protein-based probes are typically conjugated or otherwise linked to oligonucleotide encoding agents. The oligonucleotide encoding agents in this case would also include a nucleotide sequence component that allows for identification of the protein probe.\\nIn certain aspects, the present invention provides assays for evaluating differences in the amount and/or activity of biological targets between different locations in a sample and/or between samples. The method includes determining a plurality of encoded results from the biological sample and evaluating the differences in quantity of the biological targets at each location in the biological sample.\\nCombinatorial Embodiments\\nTo maximize the efficiency of encoding, a combinatorial approach using pairs of coding tags in the encoding oligonucleotides can be used. By de-coupling the target-specific information and the coding tags, the number of oligonucleotides required is dramatically reduced, with a concomitant decrease in cost.\\n FIG. 4 illustrates a general mechanism for one embodiment of a combinatorial encoding scheme of the assay systems of the invention, where nucleic acids in a representative tissue section (shown at 416) are assayed. FIG. 4 at A shows two target-specific/encoding oligonucleotide constructs 420 and 422 (e.g., formed between  steps  302 and 304 of FIG. 3) specifically bound to a target nucleic acid 402 of interest, The first encoded probe 420 comprises coding tag 408, associated with, e.g., a universal priming site for amplification of the assay products or an adapter to enable identification of the coding identifiers using sequencing technologies 404. The second encoded probe 422 comprises coding tag 406, associated with, e.g., a universal priming site for amplification of the assay products or an adapter to enable identification of the coding identifiers using sequencing technologies 410.\\n FIG. 4 at B shows the spatial pattern that may be used for twenty different coding tags, a1 through a10 (coding tag 406 on encoded probe 420) and b1 through b10 (coding tag 408 encoded probe 422). Coding tag a1., for example, is deposited on the biological sample in ten discrete areas or spots (shown as the first horizontal line of spots in 412). Coding tag a2 is deposited on the biological sample in ten spots on the second horizontal line in 412. Coding tag a3 is deposited on the biological sample in ten spots on the third horizontal line in 412, and so on. Whereas the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ca\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d tags are deposited in ten horizontal rows, the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d tags are deposited in ten vertical rows as shown in 414. For example, coding tag b1 is deposited on the biological sample in ten discrete spots in the first vertical row of 414, coding tag b2 is deposited on the biological sample in ten discrete spots in the second vertical row of 414, and so on. Using such a configuration allows for twenty coding tags to uniquely define 100 different locations on the biological sample.\\n FIG. 4 at C shows a representative tissue section 416 coincident with coding tag grid 418. The arrows show how the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ca\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d coding tags and the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cb\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d coding tags are deposited on grid 418 that is coincident with tissue section 416. If, once sequenced, coding tags a1 and b4, e.g., are associated with a target nucleic acid sequence, then that target nucleic acid sequence (i.e., biological target) was present in the tissue section at location a1, b4.\\n FIG. 5 provides a simplified, specific example of the encoding scheme of the assay systems of the invention. FIG. 5 shows encoding oligonucleotides 510, comprising a1, a2, a3, a4 and b1, b3, b3 and b4. Target-specific oligonucleotides (TSOs) (probes) 1 and 2 are shown at 520. A deposit or dispensing scheme is shown at 530. Like the grid exemplified in FIG. 4, encoding oligonucleotides a1 through a4 are deposited in spots in a pattern (here, in a vertical pattern), and encoding oligonucleotides b1 through b4 are deposited in spots in a pattern (here, a horizontal pattern). The grid though shown as a square with spots is actually a deposition pattern on a biological sample (not shown) such as tissue section 416 shown in FIG. 4.\\nThe target-specific oligonucleotides are delivered to the biological sample, where the target-specific oligonucleotides hybridize to target nucleic acids in the biological sample if target nucleic acids are present. Unhybridized target-specific oligonucleotides are then removed, e.g., by washing. The encoding oligonucleotides are then delivered to the biological sample according to the spatial pattern shown at 530. The encoding oligonucleotides are ligated (or, e.g., extended and ligated) to any target-specific oligonucleotides that hybridized to the target nucleic acid in the biological sample, the ligated constructs are then eluted from the biological sample, pooled, and sequencing adapters are added through, e.g., PCR or ligation, if the sequences were not previously included in the encoding oligonucleotides. The ligated constructs are sequenced by, e.g., high throughput or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnext generation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d sequencing.\\nThe pool of resulting sequences is shown at 540. A sequence readout was obtained for target-specific oligonucleotide 1 only at a4b1, a4b2, a1b3, a2b3, a3b3, a4b3 and a4b4 (positions shown with horizontal lines). A sequence readout was obtained for target-specific oligonucleotide 2 only at a1b1 (position shown with vertical lines). A sequence readout was obtained for both target- specific oligonucleotides  1 and 2 at positions a2b1, a3b1, a1b2, a2b2, and a3b2 (positions shown with cross-hatching). No sequence readout was obtained for either target-specific oligonucleotides at a1b4, a2b4 or a3b4 (positions shown without shading). Thus, in the biological sample on which the assay took place the first target nucleic acid was detected in a large portion of the left side and at the bottom of the biological sample, the second target nucleic acid was detected only in the upper left portion of the biological sample, and neither target nucleic acid was detected in the upper right portion of the biological sample. The differential expression of the two target nucleic acids now can be mapped back to the biological sample and to the biological structures or cell types in these locations in the biological sample, as shown in 550.\\nIn addition to location information, information relating to relative abundance of the encoded tags can be obtained. For example, if it is found that there are ten times as many a4T1b1 sequences occurring in the data set as compared to a4T1b2 sequences, this would indicate that target nucleic acid sequence 1 is ten times more abundant at the a4T1b1 location than at the a4T1b2 location.\\nIn the case of nucleotide analysis as shown in FIG. 3, by ligating the coding tags directly to target-specific oligonucleotides, only 2n target-specific oligonucleotides are needed for n targets. For example, using the combinatorial approach outlined in FIG. 2, assaying 100 different targets at 10,000 spatial locations would require 2\\u00c3\\u0097100 target-specific oligonucleotides and 2\\u00c3\\u0097100 encoding oligonucleotides. The total count of assay oligonucleotides would be only 400 (200 target-specific and 200 encoding), not counting universal primers. In contrast, if the coding oligonucleotides were not decoupled from the target-specific oligonucleotides, (n\\u00c3\\u0097X positional codes)+(n\\u00c3\\u0097Y positional codes) would be needed, or in the above example, 20,000 oligonucleotides, not counting universal primer sequences. Moreover, though the embodiments shown in FIGS. 2-5 depict a combinatorial scheme using two encoding agents (coding tags), three, four or more encoding agents and coding tags may be used, and attached to the probe or one another by varying means and in varying combinations of steps.\\nDue to the spatial encoding aspect of the assay system of the invention, a large amount of information can be generated with even a modest number of assays. For example, five or more biological targets assayed at five or more positions in the sample generates 25 or more combinations. Using digital sequencing as a readout, the optimum number of sequence reads per combination depends on the sensitivity and dynamic range required, and can be adjusted, For example, if for each combination on average 100 reads are sampled, the total for 25 combination is 25,000 reads. If 1,000 targets are assayed at 1,000 locations with an average sampling depth of 1,000, then 109 reads are required. These numbers, although large, are within the capacity of intrinsically parallel digital sequencing methods, which can generate datasets of billions or even trillions of reads in a reasonable timeframe and at a very low cost per read. Therefore, by varying the numbers of positions interrogated or biological targets assayed, or both, and using digital sequencing, large amounts of information can be obtained. In specific aspects, multiple locations are interrogated for two or more biological molecules.\\nReagent Delivery Systems\\nThe reagent delivery system of the invention includes instrumentation that allows the delivery of reagents to discrete portions of the biological sample, maintaining the integrity of the spatial patterns of the encoding scheme. Reagent delivery systems of the assay systems of the invention comprise optional imaging means, reagent delivery hardware and control software. Reagent delivery can be achieved in a number of different ways. It should be noted that reagent delivery may be to many different biological samples at one time. A single tissue section has been exemplified herein; however, multiple biological samples may be affixed and analyzed simultaneously. For example, pions of a tissue sample can be analyzed in parallel and the data combined to build a 3D map.\\nIntegral to the assay system of the invention is instrumentation that allows for spatial patterning of reagents onto the biological sample. Technologies for formulating and delivering both biological molecules (e.g. oligonucleotides or antibodies) and chemical reagents (e.g., small molecules or dNTPs) are known in the art, and uses of these instrument systems are known to one skilled in the art and easily adaptable to the assay systems of the invention. One example of a suitable reagent delivery system is the Labcyte\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 Echo acoustic liquid handier, which can be used to deliver nanoliter scale droplets containing biological molecules with high precision and reproducibility. One skilled in the art could incorporate this reagent delivery device into the overall system, using software to specify the locations to which reagents should be delivered.\\nOther instruments that can be used for the deposition of agents and/or coding identifiers onto biological samples include, but are not limited to, ink jet spotting; mechanical spotting by means of pin, pen or capillary; micro contact printing; photochemical or photolithographic methods; and the like. For several applications, it may be preferred to segment or sequester certain areas of the biological samples into one or more assay areas for different reagent distributions and/or biological target determination. The assay areas may be physically separated using barriers or channels.\\nIn one exemplary aspect, the reagent delivery system may be a flow-based system. The flow-based systems for reagent delivery in the present invention can include instrumentation such as one or more pumps, valves, fluid reservoirs, channels, and/or reagent storage cells. Reagent delivery systems are configured to move fluid to contact a discrete section of the biological sample. Movement of the reagents can be driven by a pump disposed, for example, downstream of the fluid reagents. The pump can drive each fluid reagent to (and past) the reaction compartment. Alternatively, reagents may be driven through the fluid by gravity. US Pub. Nos. 20070166725 and 20050239192 disclose certain general-purpose fluidics tools that can be used with the assay systems of the invention, allowing for the precise manipulation of gases, liquids and solids to accomplish very complex analytical manipulations with relatively simple hardware.\\nIn a more specific example, one or more flow-cells can be attached to the substrate-affixed biological sample from above. The flow-cell can include inlet and outlet tubes connected thereto and optionally an external pump is used to deliver reagents to the flow-cell and across the biological sample. The flow cells are configured to deliver reagents only to certain portions of the biological sample, restricting the amount and type of reagent delivered to any specific section of the biological sample.\\nIn another aspect, a microfluidic system can be integrated into the substrate upon which the biological sample is disposed or externally attached on top of the substrate. Microfluidic passages for holding and carrying fluid may be formed on and/or above the planar substrate by a fluidics layer abutted to the substrate. Fluid reagents can be selected and delivered according to selective opening and closing of valves disposed between reagent reservoirs.\\nPumps generally include any mechanism for moving fluid and/or reagents disposed in fluid. In some examples, the pump can be configured to move fluid and/or reagents through passages with small volumes (i.e., microfluidic structures). The pump can operate mechanically by exerting a positive or negative pressure on fluid and/or on a structure carrying fluid, electrically by appropriate application of an electric field(s), or both, among other means. Exemplary mechanical pumps may include syringe pumps, peristaltic pumps, rotary pumps, pressurized gas, pipettors, etc. Mechanical pumps may be micromachined, molded, etc. Exemplary electrical pumps may include electrodes and may operate by electrophoresis, electroendoosmosis, electrocapillarity, dielectrophoresis (including traveling wave forms thereof), and/or the like.\\nValves generally include any mechanism for regulating the passage of fluid through a channel. Valves can include, for example, deformable members that can be selectively deformed to partially or completely close a channel, a movable projection that can be selectively extended into a channel to partially or completely block a channel, an electrocapillary structure, and/or the like.\\nAn open gasket can be attached to the top of the biological sample and the sample and reagents can be injected into the gasket. Suitable gasket materials include, but are not limited to, neoprene, nitrile, and silicone rubber. Alternatively, a watertight reaction chamber may be formed by a gasket sandwiched between the biological sample on the substrate and a chemically inert, water resistant material such as, but not limited to, black-anodized aluminum, thermoplastics (e.g., polystyrene, polycarbonate, etc), glass, etc.\\nIn an optional embodiment, the assay system comprises imaging means to determine features and organization of the biological sample of interest. The images obtained, e.g., may be used to design the deposition pattern of the reagents, Imaging means are optional, as an individual can instead view the biological sample using, e.g., a microscope, analyze the organization of the biological sample, and specify a spatial pattern for delivery assay reagents. If included, the delivery system can comprise a microcircuit arrangement including an imager, such as a CCD or IGFET-based (e.g., CMOS-based) imager and an ultrasonic sprayer for reagent delivery such as described in US Pub. No. 20090197326, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also, it should be noted that although FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate using a x,y grid configuration, other configurations can be used, such as, e.g., following the topology of a tissue sample; targeting certain groups of cells, cell layers and/or cell types in a tissue, and the like.\\nIn yet another alternative, the reagent delivery system controls the delivery of reagents to specific patterns on a biological sample surface using semiconductor techniques such as masking and spraying. Specific areas of a biological sample can be protected from exposure to reagents through use of a mask to protect specific areas from exposure. The reagents may be introduced to the biological sample using conventional techniques such as spraying or fluid flow. The use of masked delivery results in a patterned delivery scheme on the substrate surface.\\nIn a preferred aspect of the invention, the reagent delivery instrumentation is based on inkjet printing technology. There are a variety of different ink-jetting mechanisms (e.g., thermal, piezoelectric) and compatibility has been shown with aqueous and organic ink formulations. Sets of independently actuated nozzles can be used to deliver multiple reagents at the same time, and very high resolutions are be achieved.\\nIn order to target specific sites of interest, an informative image of the biological sample to be assayed may be used to assist in the reagent delivery methods and associated encoding scheme. Sample regions of the biological sample can be identified using image processing (e.g., images of cell types differentiated by immunohistochemistry or other staining chemistries) integrated with other features of the assay system. In some aspects, software is used to automatically translate image information into a reagent delivery pattern. A mechanism to register and align very precisely the biological sample for reagent delivery is thus an important component of the assay systems of the invention. Mechanisms such as the use of fiducial markers on slides and/or other very accurate physical positioning systems can be adapted to this purpose.\\nThe invention preferably comprises a complete suite of software tailored to the assay system. Optionally, oligonucleotide design software is used to design the encoding nucleotides (and in embodiments where nucleic acids are assayed, the target-specific oligonucleotides) for the specific assay to be run, and may be integrated as a part of the system. Also optionally, algorithms and software for reagent delivery and data analysis (i.e., sequence analysis) may be integrated to determine assay results. Integrated data analysis is particularly useful, as the type of dataset that is generated may be massive as a consequence of scale. Algorithms and software tools that are specifically designed for analysis of the spatially-associated data generated by the assay systems, including pattern-analysis software and visualization tools, enhance the value of the data generated by the assay systems.\\nIn certain aspects, the assay system comprises processes for making and carrying out the quality control of reagents, e.g., the integrity and sequence fidelity of oligonucleotide pools. In particular, reagents are formulated according to factors such as volatility, stability at key temperatures, and chemical compatibility for compatibility with the reagent delivery instrumentation and may be analyzed by instrumentation integrated within the assay system.\\nSequencing\\nNumerous methods can be used to identify the coding tags and probe sequences in the encoded probes of the assay systems of the invention. The coding tags can be detected using techniques such as mass spectroscopy (e.g., Maldi-T of, LC-MS/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, or, preferably, nucleic acid sequencing. Examples of techniques for decoding the coding tags of the present invention can be found, for example, in US Pub. No. 20080220434, which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the coding tags may be oligonucleotide mass tags (OMTs or massTags). Such tags are described, e.g., in US Pub. No. 20090305237, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In yet another alternative, the encoded probes can be amplified and hybridized to a microarray. This would require separate amplification reactions to be carried out, in which each amplification is specific to a particular spatial code or subset of codes, accomplished by using code-specific primers. Each amplification would also incorporate a different resolvable label (e.g. fluorophor). Following hybridization, the relative amounts of a particular target mapping to different spatial locations in the sample can be determined by the relative abundances of the resolvable labels.\\nIn one particularly preferred aspect, the resulting coding tags according to the assay system are substrates for high-throughput, next-generation sequencing, and highly parallel next-generation sequencing methods are used to confirm the sequence of the coding tags, for example, with SOLiD\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 technology (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Genome Ananlyzer (Illumina, Inc.). Such next-generation sequencing methods can be carried out, for example, using a one pass sequencing method or using paired-end sequencing. Next generation sequencing methods include, but are not limited to, hybridization-based methods, such as disclosed in e.g., Drmanac, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,864,052; 6,309,824; and 6,401,267; and Drmanac et al, U.S. patent publication 2005/0191656; sequencing-by-synthesis methods, e.g., U.S. Pat.

For example, combining the ability to estimate the relative abundance of different RNA transcripts with the ability to reconstruct an image of spatial patterns of abundance across many locations, which may be as small as or even smaller than individual cells, in a tissue enables many different areas of basic research. The following are exemplary uses and are by no means meant to be limiting in scope.\\nIn one example, 3-dimensional patterns of gene expression are determined by analyzing a series of tissue sections, in a manner analogous to image reconstruction in CT scanning, Such a method can be used to measure changes in gene expression in disease pathology, e.g., in cancerous tissue and/or a tissue upon injury, inflammation or infection. With the assay systems of the invention, more detailed information on gene expression and protein localization in complex tissues is obtained, leading to new insights into the function and regulation both in normal and diseased states, and provides new hypotheses that can be tested. For example, an assay system of the invention may enable some of the insights gained from many individual studies and larger programs like ENCODE (Birney, et al., Nature, 447:799-816 (2007)) and modENCODE to be integrated at the tissue level. The assay systems also aid computational efforts to model interacting networks of gene expression in the field of systems biology.\\nThe assay systems also provide a novel approach to analysis of somatic variation, e.g., somatic mutations in cancer or variability in response to infectious organisms. For example, tumors are typically highly heterogeneous, containing cancer cells as well as genetically normal cells in an abnormal local environment. Cancer cells undergo mutation and selection, and in this process it is not unusual for local clones to develop. Identifying relatively rare somatic mutations in the context of tumors may enable the study of the role of key mutations in the selection of clonal variants. Transcriptional patterns associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, or other cancer-related processes in both cancer and genetically normal cells can be analyzed for insights into cancer biology and assist in the development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers. In another example, individuals have varying susceptibility to infectious organisms, and the assay systems of the invention can be used to study the interaction between microbes and tissues or the various cell types within the tissue.\\nImportantly, in addition to providing spatially-associated information, the invention allows a great increase in the sensitivity of detecting rare mutations, as signal to noise can be dramatically increased since only a small location is assayed in any given reaction. In a typical assay for rare mutations in a mixed sample, the sample is treated in bulk, i.e., nucleic acids are extracted from many cells into a single pool. Thus, if a mutation is present in one cell in 10,000, it must be detected against a background of normal DNA from \\u00cb\\u009c10,000 cells. In contrast, with the assay systems of the invention many cells can be analyzed, but individual cells or small groups of cells would be identified by the spatial coding system. Therefore, in the assay systems of the present invention, background is reduced by orders of magnitude, greatly increasing sensitivity. Furthermore, the spatial organization of mutant cells can be observed, which may be particularly important in detecting key mutations in tissue sections in cancer. Already molecular histological analyses are yielding insights into cancer biology and may have potential for use in diagnostics. The technology of the invention promises to greatly increase the power of such approaches.\\nThe present invention provides assays, assay systems, and methods of using such assays in spatially encoded biological assays. The invention provides an assay system comprising one or more agents provided in defined spatial patterns on a substrate surface, and a detection system for identifying the presence or absence, relative amount, and location of a biological molecule. Such biological molecules include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, peptides, carbohydrates, cellular components, and the like. The assay system is a novel multiplexing approach, as it allows multiple molecules and their respective multiple locations to be identified in a single system using a unique encoding scheme. This encoding scheme uses both molecule-specific binding agents and coding identifiers to provide a practical and cost-effective determination of information on multiple biological molecules, including specific positional information of such molecules in a biological sample, e.g., a tissue section. The single molecule detection analysis using the encoding system also allows relative amounts of biological molecules to be detected, thus providing information on expression levels, sequestering in specific locales, and the like.\\nThe assay systems detect the presence or absence, and relative amount, of a biological molecule at more than one spatial location in a sample. In addition, the assays provide methods for doing this for multiple biological molecules simultaneously. The assay systems utilize one or more binding agents that specifically bind to the biological molecule of interest and unique coding identifiers associated with specific binding agents. The detection system utilizes a method for identifying the presence and spatial address of the agent binding based on the positive and/or negative results that are obtained using detection of the agent and identifier and the encoding scheme of the spatial patterns on the substrate surface. In a specific aspect, the encoding scheme employs limited reagent delivery to the spatial patterns on the substrate surface, and access of the coding identifiers and/or binding agents to portions of the sample is controlled through such limited delivery.\\nIn one aspect, the assay system detects the presence or absence and spatial location of a biological molecule based on the positive and/or negative results that are obtained using limited reagent delivery and the encoding scheme of the spatial patterns on the substrate surface.\\nThe assay system and methods of the invention are based on relational, solid-state substrates with positions that represent specific spatial locations within a biological sample, e.g., a cell, organelle or tissue. The ability to use encoding features to represent locations allows high-throughput analysis of the presence or absence, and relative amount, of a biological molecule at more than one spatial location in a sample. The encoding features also allow provide assaying of multiple biological molecules at these multiple locations simultaneously.\\nA primary feature of the invention is the preservation of the spatial organization of elements in a sample of interest through the use of an encoding scheme. For example, the assay may be designed to preserve the relative position of cells in a tissue, and the assay may interrogate the individual cells for genomic DNA variation (including epigenetic modifications), and RNA and protein expression.\\nIn one specific aspect, the encoding scheme of the assay system comprises the use of two or more coding patterns, each comprising regions defined by spatial patterns on the substrate surface. For example, the assay system can utilize an encoding scheme that comprises a 2-dimensional grid format based on the discrete positioning of the binding agents in the substrate surfaces. In another example, the spatial patterns may be based on more randomized cell locations, e.g., the patterns on the substrate surface follow an underlying biological structure rather than a strict, x,y grid pattern. This aspect includes systems with two or more substantially identical spatial patterns using different binding agents and/or coding identifiers, as well as systems having different patterns for different agents and/or coding identifiers. The encoding scheme of the systems can be controlled by delivery of different reagents to discrete regions on the substrate surfaces, which allows different reactions to take place on substantially similar agents of known location on the substrate surfaces.\\nIn one specific aspect, the invention provides high resolution, high-throughput analysis of nucleic acids and/or expression levels that provides both detection and spatial identification of large numbers of nucleic acids, e.g., DNA or RNA.\\nIn another specific aspect, the invention provides high resolution, high-throughput analysis of proteins that provides both detection and spatial identification of large numbers of such proteins, e.g., kinases or proteases.\\nNumerous reagent delivery systems can be used with the assay system of the invention. The primary criteria of such reagent delivery systems is the ability to direct delivery of specific agents based on spatial patterns on the substrate surface.\\nIn one preferred aspect, the encoding scheme utilizes a reagent delivery system based on printing and informatics technologies to implement the spatial patterns used for identification and localization of the biological materials. For example, the patterns found in the encoding scheme may be created using ink jet printing technology to provide reagents at specific locations on one or more substrate surfaces. The desired patterns are set out in specific coding patterns on the substrate surface.\\nIn certain aspects of the invention, the binding agents are immobilized directly to the substrate surface, and the location of the binding agents is known or determined prior to use of the substrate surface in the assay system. In another aspect, the binding agents are immobilized onto beads or other separate structural elements that are then provided in known locations on the substrate surface. In yet another aspect, the binding agents may be provided in or on features of the substrate surface, e.g., provided in wells or channels.\\nIn specific aspects of the invention, the binding agents are nucleic acids immobilized directly or indirectly to the substrate surface, e.g., directly through the use of amino groups on the substrate surface or indirectly through the use of a linker. The location of the nucleic acid sequences is known or determined prior to use of the substrate surface in the assay system. In another specific aspect, the nucleic acids may be immobilized directly or indirectly onto beads that are then provided in known locations on the substrate surface. In yet another aspect, the nucleic acids may be provided in or on features of the substrate surface, e.g., provided in wells.\\nIn these aspects involving nucleic acid agents, any methods of sequence determination can be used, e.g., sequencing, hybridization and the like. In a preferred aspect, nucleic acid sequencing, and preferably next-generation sequencing, is used to decode the spatial encoding scheme in the assay system of the invention. This provides a very wide dynamic range for very large numbers of assays, allowing for efficient multiplexing.\\nIn some aspects, the assay utilizes two or more oligonucleotides, the oligonucleotides comprising a universal primer region and a region that correlates specifically to a single spatial pattern within the spatial encoding scheme. In a specific aspect, the assay comprises two allele specific oligonucleotides and one locus specific oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides allow the identification of specific SNPs, indels or mutations within an allele. This is useful in the identification of genetic changes in somatic cells, genotyping of tissues, and the like.\\nIn other specific aspects of the invention, the binding agents are peptides. In one aspect, these peptides are associated directly or indirectly to known locations on a substrate surface, e.g., using binding protein pairs or through oligonucleotide linkers complementary to oligonucleotides on the substrate surface. In another aspect, the binding agents are peptides are immobilized directly or indirectly onto beads or other separate structural elements that are then provided in known locations on the substrate surface. In yet another aspect, the peptides may be provided in or on features of the substrate surface, e.g., provided in wells.\\nIn yet other specific aspects of the invention, the binding agents are chemical entities (e.g., small molecules) that are coded, e.g. using sequence tags or mass spectroscopy tags as coding identifiers. In one aspect, these chemical entities can be are immobilized directly to the substrate surface. In another aspect, the binding agents are immobilized onto beads or other separate structural elements that are then provided in known locations on the substrate surface. In yet another aspect, the binding agents may be provided in or on features of the substrate surface, e.g., provided in wells.\\nThe assay system of the invention can utilize various detection mechanisms, based on the molecules to be detected and the reagents needed for such detection system. Exemplary methods that can be used with the assay systems of the invention are described in more detail below.\\nThe Invention in General\\nThe assay system and methods of the invention are based on relational methods that allow extraction of data to detect the presence or absence and relative amount of a biological molecule, and the location of this molecule in a sample having a distinct structure, e.g., a tissue section or other biological structure with distinct locations of specific biological molecules. The encoding scheme used in these systems corresponds to the structural elements of the sample, and the information obtained using a two-dimensional coding system is indicative of the spatial addresses of these molecules in a sample of interest.\\nIntegral to the assay system of the invention is a method for spatial patterning of reagents. Technologies for formulating and delivering both biological molecules (e.g. DNA or antibodies) and chemical reagents (e.g., small molecules or dNTPs) have already been demonstrated, and use of these systems will be available to one skilled in the art and easily adaptable upon reading this specification.\\nThe assay design of the invention provides an accurate and easily scalable spatial encoding system. The ability to deliver reagents in a spatially defined pattern together with software, reagents and protocols comprises a novel and highly innovative assay system for spatial analysis of various biological molecules and activities. This allows the assays to measure numerous biological functions in a meaningful spatial environment, including functions such as gene expression and peptide localization. The systems provide the potential to open a new analytical window into the complex spatial patterns of cellular function and regulation in biological systems.\\nThe biological molecules to be detected can be any biological molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, ions, or multicomponent complexes containing any of the above. Further examples of subcellular objects include organelles, e.g., mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, chloroplast, endocytic vesicle, exocytic vesicles, vacuole, lysosome, etc.\\n FIG. 4 illustrates such a target-specific assay system for identification of nucleic acid sequences in a sample. In this system, two  reagents  420, 422 that specifically bind to a biological molecule of interest are associated with  coding identifiers  406, 408 that encode for a spatial location in the sample. These  coding identifiers  406, 408 are optionally associated with sites that assist in their identification in the assay format, e.g.,  universal priming sites  404, 410 for amplification of the assay products or adapters to enable identification of the coding identifiers and the binding agents using sequencing technologies. The sample that is tested, here shown as a tissue section 416 is encoded using the combination of the  patterns  412, 414 created using the  separate coding identifiers  406, 408 which provide a two dimensional code 418 that shows the location of any positive detection of the biological molecule 402 as well as quantifying the biological molecule 402 at each location assayed in the tissue.\\nThe assay systems of the invention are particularly advantageous in that they are compatible with numerous samples types, such as fresh samples, such as primary tissue sections, and preserved samples including but not limited to frozen samples and paraformalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. An important aspect of the assay systems of the invention is that the binding agents are immobilized on a substrate surface in discrete, independently measureable areas. These discrete areas can be formed by spatially selective deposition of the binding agents on the substrate surface. Numerous methods can be used for the deposition of the agent and the coding identifiers associates with the agent. For example, the coding identifiers can be delivered together or separately from the agent. If delivered together they can be attached (e.g., synthesized as a single molecule or attached through ligation or a chemical coupling mechanism) or simply mixed together to be attached after delivery to the substrate. In a preferred aspect, the agent and the coding identifier are made separately, mixed together for attachment, and delivered either attached or as a mixture to be attached on the surface. In a specific aspect the binding agents are delivered generally over the substrate surface and the coding identifiers are delivered in a pattern-specific manner.\\nExamples of methods that can be used for deposition of agents and/or coding identifiers onto the substrate surface include, but are not limited to, ink jet spotting, mechanical spotting by means of pin, pen or capillary, micro contact printing, fluidically contacting the measurement areas with the biological or biochemical or synthetic recognition elements upon their supply in parallel or crossed micro channels, upon exposure to pressure differences or to electric or electromagnetic potentials, and photochemical or photolithographic immobilization methods.\\nFor several applications, it may be preferred to arrange the substrates into segments of one or more measurement areas for reagent distribution and agent determination. These regions may be physically separated using barriers or channels. They may still comprise several additional discrete measurement areas with agents that are different or in different combination from each other.\\nIn certain aspects, the present invention provides a method, e.g., a machine-based method, for evaluating changes in the presence and/or location of a biological molecule over time. The method includes providing a plurality of encoded array results representative of the biological molecule over time and evaluating the differences in detection and/or localization of the biological molecules.\\nNucleic Acid Detection and Localization\\nIn a particular aspect, the assay system is used to analyze nucleic acids, e.g genotyping, gene expression analysis, localization of particular transcripts within samples, and the like.\\nGenotyping may be performed using any technique known to those of skill in the art. Preferred techniques permit rapid, accurate determination of multiple variations with a minimum of sample handling. Some examples of suitable techniques involve but are not limited to direct DNA sequencing, capillary electrophoresis, hybridization, allele-specific probes or primers, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, nucleic acid arrays, bead arrays, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, cleavage fragment length polymorphism analysis, random amplified polymorphic DNA, ligase detection reaction, heteroduplex or fragment analysis, differential sequencing with mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, pyrosequencing, FRET (e.g., TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.) and Molecular Beacon (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) assays), and other related techniques. Several methods for DNA sequencing are well known and generally available in the art. See, for example, Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York) (2001); Ausubel, et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley and Sons, New York) (1997), Twyman, et al. (2003) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTechniques Patents for SNP Genotyping\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, Pharmacogenomics 4(1):67-79; and Kristensen, et al. (2001) \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHigh-Throughput Methods for Detection of Genetic Variation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, BioTechniques 30(2):318-332. For details on the use of nucleic acid arrays (DNA chips) for the detection of, for example, SNPs, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,063 issued to Lipshultz, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,832 to Chee, et al., HuSNP Mapping Assay, reagent kit and user manual, Affymetrix Part No. 90094 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.). The molecular inversion probe (MIP) assay format (Hardenbol et al., 2003) is another example of a highly multiplexable assay that may be used with the assay systems of the invention.\\nIn one exemplary and preferred method for analyzing nucleic acids using the assay system of the invention, the detection of nucleic acids uses two allele-specific oligonucleotides and a locus specific oligonucleotide. The assay methods are carried out according to the strategy outlined in FIG. 2 using next-generation sequencing or another highly parallel nucleic acid assay technology. In this assay, a set of two oligonucleotides is designed to hybridize to each target sequence, with a common oligonucleotide and two unique coding identifiers. The allele can be determined, e,g, by primer extension of the locus specific oligonucleotide. Following primer extension and ligation, an amplifiable template is formed with universal primer sequences at either end. Assay oligonucleotides are annealed to a template and enzymatic reactions are used to join the two oligonucleotides only when both are correctly annealed. The detection techniques and read out parameters used in this system of the invention include a much shorter tag than the oligonucleotides used in the assays that are based on capture by hybridization. These shorter tags are designed to be read out by sequencing or, preferably, used to ligate codes onto both ends of the fragment as illustrated in FIG. 2.\\nIn FIG. 3, two target-specific assay oligonucleotides are ligated together 302 following in situ hybridization to target sequences. At the same time, encoding oligonucleotides containing tag sequence sets X and Y are ligated 304 to the target specific oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides containing X ligate specifically to one side of the targeting construct and oligonucleotides containing Y ligate to the other. The oligonucleotides contain universal primer sites P1 and P2. Following ligation, the constructs are eluted and, optionally, sequencing adapters can be attached 306, e.g., via PCR.\\nIn one preferred aspect, the final construct created from the assay method is a substrate for next-generation sequencing, and highly parallel next-generation sequencing methods are used to confirm the sequence of constructs. Such sequencing methods can be carried out, for example, using a one pass sequencing method or using paired-end sequencing. Next generation sequencing methods include, but are not limited to, hybridization-based methods, such as disclosed in Drmanac, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,864,052; 6,309,824; and 6,401,267; and Drmanac et al, U.S. patent publication 2005/0191656, and sequencing by synthesis methods, e.g., Nyren et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,891; Ronaghi, U.S. Pat. No. 6,828,100; Ronaghi et al (1998), Science, 281: 363-365; Balasubramanian, U.S. Pat. No. 6,833,246; Quake, U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,345; Li et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 100: 414-419 (2003); Smith et al, PCT publication WO 2006/074351; use of reversible extension terminators, e.g., Turner, U.S. Pat. No. 6,833,246 and Turner, U.S. Pat. No. 6,833,246 and ligation-based methods, e.g., Shendure et al (2005), Science, 309: 1728-1739, Macevicz, U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,597; which references are incorporated by reference. Soddart et al., PNAS USA. 2009 Apr. 20; Xiao et al., Nat Methods. 2009 March; 6(3):199-201. Epub 2009 Feb. 8.\\nTo maximize the efficiency of encoding, a combinatorial approach using pairs of oligonucleotides can be used. For example, with only two sets of 100 codes, a substrate can theoretically encode up to 10,000 locations. The number of assay oligonucleotides required is dramatically reduced, the cost decreased, and the robustness of the approach increased by decoupling the coding sequences from the genome-specific sequences. Alternative assay formats can also be used (e.g. ligation or primer extension followed by ligation).\\nBy ligating the codes on separately, only 2n target-specific assay oligonucleotides are needed for n targets. For example, assaying 100 different targets at 10,000 spatial locations would require 2\\u00c3\\u0097100 targeting oligonucleotides and 2\\u00c3\\u0097100 encoding oligonucleotides, using a combinatorial approach outlined in FIG. 2. The total count of assay oligonucleotides would be only 400 (200 target-specific and 200 encoding), not counting universal primers. In contrast, if the coding oligonucleotides were not decoupled, (n\\u00c3\\u0097X positional codes)+(n\\u00c3\\u0097Y positional codes) would be needed, or in the above example, 20,000 oligonucleotides, not counting universal primer sequences.\\nDue to the matrix system of the invention, a large amount of information can be obtained even using five or more positions interrogated for five or more biological molecules. By varying one or the other of these, large amounts of information can be obtained, both in terms of locations and/or specific biological In specific aspects, multiple locations are interrogated for two or more biological molecules. As an example, for each datapoint \\u00cb\\u009c1,000 reads may be sampled, for a total of \\u00e2\\u0088\\u009210E9 reads for 10E6 datapoints.\\nPeptide Detection Systems\\nThe assay system of the invention can be used to analyze biological molecules using peptide agents that are associated with the substrate surface in a spatial pattern. Such peptides may comprise an active region of an enzyme, a binding domain of an immunoglobulin, defined domains of proteins, whole proteins, synthetic peptides, peptides with introduced mutations, etc.\\nThe assay system of the invention allows the identification and spatial location of various forms of peptides, including isoforms and peptides that have undergone posttranslational modification. Importantly, certain aspects of the invention allow the identification of active versus non-active forms of such peptides in a sample. This allows the identification of the presence or absence of specific peptide isoforms, and also acts as a proxy for identification of peptide activity in a sample.\\nIn certain aspects of the invention, the binding agents associated with the substrate surfaces of the assay system include substrates for enzymes or proenzymes, e.g., a kinase, a phosphatase, a zymogen, a protease, or a fragment thereof. In certain aspects, the binding agents associated with the substrate surfaces are phosphorylation substrates used to detect proteins involved with one or more signal transduction pathways, e.g., a kinase or a phosphatase. In another specific aspect of the invention, the binding agents are specific protease substrates that associate only with individual or classes of proteases. In other aspects, the binding agents on the substrate surface are different processed forms, isoforms and/or domains of an enzyme.\\nReagent Delivery\\nThe reagent delivery system of the invention can be any system that allows the delivery of reagents to discrete portions of the array in order to keep the integrity of the defined spatial patterns of the encoding scheme. Such discrete delivery can be achieved in a number of different ways.\\nIn one exemplary aspect, the reagent delivery system can be a flow-based system. The flow-based systems for reagent delivery in the present invention can include one or more pumps, valves, fluid reservoirs, channels, and/or reagent storage cells. Such a reagent delivery system is configured to move fluid in contact with a discrete section of the substrate surface. Movement of the reagents can be driven through a fluid by a pump disposed, for example, downstream of the fluid reagents. The pump can drive each fluid reagent to (and past) the reaction compartment. Alternatively, the reagents may be driven through the fluid by gravity.\\nUS Appln Nos. 20070166725 and 20050239192 disclose certain general-purpose fluidics tools that can be used with the assay systems of the invention. These allow the precise manipulation of gases, liquids and solids to accomplish very complex analytical manipulations with relatively simple hardware.\\nIn a more specific example, one or more flow-cells can be attached to the substrate from above. The flow-cell can include inlet and outlet tubes connected thereto and optionally an external pump can be used to deliver the sample or reagents to the flow-cell and across the substrate. The flow cell is configured to deliver reagents only to certain portions of the array, restricting the amount and type of reagent delivered to any specific section of the array.\\nIn another aspect, a microfluidic system can be integrated into the substrate or externally attached on top of the substrate. Microfluidic passages for holding and carrying fluid can be formed on and/or above the planar substrate by a fluidics layer abutted to the substrate. Fluid reagents can be selected according to selective opening and closing of valves disposed between reagent reservoirs.\\nPumps generally include any mechanism for moving fluid and/or reagents disposed in fluid. In some examples, the pump can be configured to move fluid and/or reagents through passages with small volumes (i.e., microfluidic structures). The pump can operate mechanically by exerting a positive or negative pressure on fluid and/or on a structure carrying fluid, electrically by appropriate application of an electric field(s), or both, among others. Exemplary mechanical pumps may include syringe pumps, peristaltic pumps, rotary pumps, pressurized gas, pipettors, etc. The mechanical pumps may be micromachined, molded, etc. Exemplary electrical pumps can include electrodes and may operate by electrophoresis, electroendoosmosis, electrocapillarity, dielectrophoresis (including traveling wave forms thereof), and/or the like.\\nValves generally include any mechanism for regulating the passage of fluid through a channel. The valves can include, for example, deformable members that can be selectively deformed to partially or completely close a channel, a movable projection that can be selectively extended into the channel to partially or completely block the channel, an electrocapillary structure, and/or the like.\\nIn yet another aspect, an open gasket can be attached to the top of the substrate and the sample and reagents can be injected into the gasket. Suitable gasket materials include, but are not limited to, neoprene, nitrile, and silicone rubber. Alternatively, a watertight reaction chamber formed by a gasket sandwiched between the substrate and a chemically inert, water resistant material such as, but not limited to, black-anodized aluminum, thermoplastics (e.g., polystyrene, polycarbonate, etc), glass, etc.\\nIn a specific aspect of the present invention, the delivery system can compnse a microcircuit arrangement including an imager, such as a CCD or IGFET-based (e.g., CMOS-based) imager and an ultrasonic sprayer for reagent delivery such as described in US Appln No. 20090197326, which is incorporated herein by reference.\\nIn yet another aspect of the invention, the reagent delivery system controls the delivery of reagents to specific patterns on a substrate surface using semiconductor techniques such as masking and spraying. Specific areas of a substrate surface can be protected from exposure to reagents through use of a mask to protect specific areas from exposure. The reagents may be introduced to the substrate using conventional techniques such as spraying or fluid flow. The use of the masked substrate delivery results in a patterned delivery scheme on the substrate surface.\\nIn a preferred aspect of the invention, the reagent delivery instrumentation is based on inkjet printing technology. There are a variety of different ink-jetting mechanisms (e.g., thermal, piezoelectric) and compatibility has been shown with aqueous and organic ink formulations. Sets of independently actuated nozzles can be used to deliver multiple reagents at the same time, and very high resolutions can be achieved.\\nSoftware for Use in the Assay System\\nIn order to target specific sites of interest, an informative image of the biological section to be analyzed can be used to assist in the reagent delivery methods and associated encoding scheme. Sample regions can be identified using image processing (e.g., images of cell types differentiated by immunohistochemistry or other staining chemistries) integrated with the other features of the assay system. In some aspects, software is used to automatically translate this information into a reagent delivery pattern. A mechanism to register and align very precisely the biological sample in a targeting system is thus a preferred component of the assay systems of the invention. Mechanisms such as the use of fiducial markers on slides and other very accurate physical positioning systems can be adapted to this purpose.\\nAdditional software components will also be key components that will be part of a complete assay system. The invention thus preferably comprises a complete suite of software tailored to the assay system. Optionally, oligonucleotide design software will be customized for the specific assay to be run, and may be integrated as a part of the system. Also optionally, algorithms and software for data analysis may be integrated to assist in determination of results of the assays. This can be especially useful, as the type of dataset that will be generated will be novel, particularly as a consequence of scale. The ability to provide algorithms and software tools that are specifically designed for analysis of spatially-associated data for significant patterns, including pattern-analysis software and visualization tools, is a novel feature that will enhance the value of the data generated by the assay systems.\\nIn certain aspects, the assay system will comprise processes for making and carrying out quality control of reagents, e.g., the integrity and sequence fidelity of oligonucleotide pools. In particular, reagents will need to be formulated for compatibility with the reagent delivery instrumentation. Factors such as volatility, stability at key temperatures, and chemical compatibility can be optimized by those skilled in the art upon reading the present disclosure.\\nApplications of Assay System\\nIt will be apparent to one skilled in the art upon reading the present disclosure that there are numerous very important areas of biological research, diagnostics, and drug development that will benefit from a high throughput means to simultaneously measure the presence or absence and spatial location of a biological molecule in a sample. For example, this technology combining the ability to analyze semi-quantitatively the expression of many different genes with the ability to image the spatial organization of expression across many cells in a tissue is enabling for many different areas of basic research. The following are exemplary uses and are by no means meant to be limiting in scope.\\nIn one example, 3-dimensional patterns of expression can be determined by analyzing a series of tissue sections, in a manner analogous to image reconstruction in CT scanning. This can be used to measure changes in gene expression in disease pathology, e.g., in cancerous tissue and/or a tissue upon injury, inflammation or infection. With the assay systems of the invention, more detailed information on gene expression and protein localization in complex tissues can be obtained. This may lead to new insights into the function and regulation both in normal and diseased states, and is likely to provide new hypotheses that can be tested. For example, a system of the invention may enable some of the insights gained from many individual studies and larger programs like ENCODE (Birney et al., 2007) and modENCODE to be integrated at the tissue level. The assay systems will also aid in computational efforts to model interacting networks of gene expression in the field of systems biology.\\nThe assay systems also provide a novel approach that enables the analysis of somatic variation, e.g., somatic mutations in cancer or variability in response to infectious organisms. For example, tumors are typically highly heterogeneous, containing cancer cells as well as genetically normal cells in an abnormal local environment. Cancer cells undergo mutation and selection, and in this process it is not unusual for local clones to develop. Identifying relatively rare somatic mutations in the context of tumors may enable the study of the role of key mutations in the selection of clonal variants. Transcriptional patterns associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, or other cancer related processes in both cancer and genetically normal cells can be analyzed for insights into cancer biology and assist in the development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers.\\nIn another example, different people have varying susceptibility to infectious organisms, and much of this may be to underlying genetic differences in individuals and/or populations. Identifying these differences will aid in an understanding of the underlying disease pathologies and assist in the development of vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or ameliorate these disease states.\\nImportantly, in addition to providing spatially associated information, the technology of the invention will allow a great increase in the sensitivity of detecting rare mutations. The reason is that signal to noise can be dramatically increased because the approach of the invention assays a small location in any given reaction. In a typical assay for rare mutations in a mixed sample, the sample is treated in bulk, i.e. nucleic acids are extracted from many cells into a single pool. Thus, if a mutation is present in 1 cell in 10,000, it must be detected against a background of normal DNA from \\u00cb\\u009c10,000 cells. In contrast, with the systems of the invention many cells can be analyzed, but individual cells or small groups of cells would be identified by the spatial coding system. Therefore, the background can be reduced by orders of magnitude, greatly increasing sensitivity. Furthermore, the spatial organization of mutant cells can be observed. This may be particularly important in detecting key mutations in tissue sections in cancer. Already, molecular histological analyses are yielding insights into cancer biology and may have potential for use in diagnostics (Choe et al., 2003). The technology of the invention promises to greatly increase the power of such approaches.\\nEXAMPLES\\nThe following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the present invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventor regards as his invention, nor are they intended to represent or imply that the experiments below are all of or the only experiments performed. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.\\nEfforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, molecular weight is weight average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees centigrade, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.\\nExample 1\\nInitial Proof of Concept of Encoding Scheme\\nAs an initial proof of concept, a model system is developed using a microarray to demonstrate a working single-plex assay. The basic design validates the concept of the assay, and establishes a working assay prior to addressing issues related to the analysis of a more complicated biological sample. Conventional sequencing is used as a readout for this proof of concept.\\nA microarray is used as a proxy for a tissue section. The target sequences of the microarray are fully specified, so that the composition of the targets are known and can be varied systematically. Synthetic oligonucleotide templates are attached to a glass slide via a 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b2 amino modification. Each slide has a single oligonucleotide template sequence, and the assays that are carried out may employ either ligation, or extension followed by ligation as this may be useful in determining certain polymorphisms.\\nOnce the in situ part of the assay is complete, the reaction products are eluted and analyzed by qPCR to determined presence or absence of a product and estimate yield, and by conventional sequencing to determine the structure of the assay products. The single plex assays that are tested include appropriate positive and negative controls, and a single nucleotide variant (SNV) to check ability to discriminate single base variants.\\nExample 2\\nScalability\\nThe complexity of the assay system is increased to establish scalability of the assay for use in high throughput studies. Scalability of both the spatial encoding and assay systems is demonstrated by carrying out a 24-plex\\u00c3\\u009724-site assay using a microarray model system.\\nThe amount of biological target, here a DNA target sequence, at each assay location is systematically varied on microarray substrate. For example, in a microarray with 50 micron spot size (center to center), a 1 mm2 area contains \\u00cb\\u009c400 spots. The region around each site is optionally occupied by a region that is devoid of these spots to allow individual resolvability of the target sequences. Alternatively, the spots may be clustered, with two or more directly adjacent spots surrounded by or adjacent to a region that is devoid of target sequences.\\nIn order to demonstrate that spatial encoding is accurate, the sites comprise different target compositions to show that the assay readout matches the expected composition of each site. With 24 target sequences, a simple digital pattern is made with each site having a different set of 12 targets present and 12 targets absent, to make a binary code (0=absent, 1=present). The assay readout is then determined to show that the detected regions match the expected signal after spatial decoding. In this particular example, the code space is large enough (224) so that even a few errors would not result in different codes being mixed up. Moreover, this design allows identification of errors and allows an estimation not only of accuracy of spatial encoding but also of accuracy calling the presence or absence of target sequences.\\nIn an exemplary aspect, a 4\\u00c3\\u00974 arrangement of 16 sequences is used for the array configuration. A white square indicates that the sequence is absent and a black square that it is present, i.e. 8 of the 16 possible sequences are present in this sample. In a different sample, a different pattern of absent and present sequences can be constructed. In this way, unique patterns are associated with spatial locations so that the accuracy of spatial encoding can be measured.\\nThe ability to detect quantitative differences is evaluated by generating dose-response curves for each of the 24 assays that are carried out at each site in a 24-site assay. This allows estimation of the limit of detection, dynamic range, and power to detect a given fold-change across the range.\\nIn one aspect, a latin square design is used to represent individual targets at different ratios by varying the number of features for each target. In other words, with multiple spots in a site, the number of spots allocated to each of the 24 target sequences can be varied and each of the 24 sites can have a different composition. A 1\\u00c3\\u00973 inch microarray is sufficiently large to permit multiple replicates. This larger set of 24 sequences will require deconvolution, and this is accomplished using high throughput techniques such as next-generation sequencing technologies (e.g., SOLiD\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 technology (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.) or Genome Analyzer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, Calif.)). The use of the 24-plex assay demonstrates both the accuracy of spatial encoding and decoding, and the quantitative response of the assay system.\\nExample 3\\nAdaptation of the Assay to Preserved Samples\\nGenomic DNA is assayed as a proof of concept for assaying RNA, as it provides a way to establish a single-copy reference signal. Once a working assay is developed for FFPE samples, it is adapted to an RNA assay. To this end, assay oligonucleotide concentrations are assayed to ensure compatibility with high multiplexing. Assuming a cell diameter of 10 microns, and delivery of a 10 micron diameter reagent droplet to an individual cell, the volume of the droplet will be \\u00cb\\u009c500 \\u00ce\\u00bcl and can contain \\u00cb\\u009c3\\u00c3\\u00971011 molecules at a 1 \\u00ce\\u00bcM concentration. To assay 1,000 target sequences in 10,000 cells, 2,000 targeting oligonucleotides would be required in a droplet. Therefore, each droplet could contain \\u00cb\\u009c160 million copies of each assay oligo, a vast excess over the few thousand target sequences in a cell.\\nThe handling of small absolute numbers of product molecules generated from very small or compromised samples are enhanced to counter the issue of low recovery efficiency; that is, elution is efficient and losses resulting from adsorption of molecules to surfaces are prevented. An approach to addressing the latter issue is to include a carrier material, such as glycogen or carrier nucleic acids.\\nExample 4\\nAdapting the Assay to a Biological Sample\\nA control RNA template is immobilized to a solid support in order to create an artificial system. The assay is performed using T4 DNA ligase, which can repair nicks in DNA/RNA hybrids. Assays are carried out on matched slides, or different sections of the same slide, where in one case gDNA is assayed and in the other RNA is assayed. When assaying gDNA the slide can be pretreated with RNase, and when assaying RNA the slide is pretreated with DNase. Results of the assay are confirmed by extracting gDNA or RNA and quantitating the relative amounts by qPCR or RT-qPCR respectively.\\nIn order make the tissue section RNA assays as informative as possible, pre-existing information on expression levels in specific tissues to target transcripts across a range of abundances are used in the assay design. Both high abundance transcripts, as well as some medium and low abundance transcripts, are targeted to enable an initial assessment of the quantitative performance characteristics of the assay.\\nThe preceding merely illustrates the principles of the invention.

A platform manages data objects processed by software services and/or those entities that initiate processing events. The platform uses identifiers such as, for example, a persistent identifier (PID) to track processing events, The platform implements rules and/or permissions related to the managed data objects and/or managed entities to determine whether processing events are in compliance. The platform may update database records, send alerts, send data graphs, or provide a real-time stream related to the managed data objects and/or managed entities. In addition, embodiments involve determining whether a PID-associated managed data object has been modified during processing to generate an additional version of the PID-associated managed data object and, if an object version is present, processing the additional version of the PID-associated managed data object to generate an integrated first PID-associated managed data object. \\n\",\n          \"Patent ID \\\"US-11178503-B2\\\" titled \\\"System for rendering and playback of object based audio in various listening environments \\\" \\nhas a publication date of \\\"2021-11-16\\\" \\nThe abstract of the patent is Embodiments are described for a system of rendering object-based audio content through a system that includes individually addressable drivers, including at least one driver that is configured to project sound waves toward one or more surfaces within a listening environment for reflection to a listening area within the listening environment; a renderer configured to receive and process audio streams and one or more metadata sets associated with each of the audio streams and specifying a playback location of a respective audio stream; and a playback system coupled to the renderer and configured to render the audio streams to a plurality of audio feeds corresponding to the array of audio drivers in accordance with the one or more metadata sets. \\n\",\n          \"Patent ID \\\"US-11445326-B2\\\" titled \\\"Track engagement of media items \\\" \\nhas a publication date of \\\"2022-09-13\\\" \\nThe abstract of the patent is An engagement tracking system monitors user interactions with media items to calculate an engagement score of the media item. The engagement tracking system may be or include a group of one or more server machines configured to detect an exposure of a client device to a media item maintained by the engagement tracking system. In response to detecting the exposure of the client device to the media item, the engagement tracking system tracks a location of the client device based on access requests to location based media items. The engagement tracking system may thereby monitor client devices exposed to the media item in order to calculate an engagement score of the media item. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Please note that these steps are specific to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and may vary depending on the jurisdiction.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Patentability**\n\nBefore filing a patent application, it is essential to determine whether your invention is patentable. You can do this by conducting a patent search to identify existing patents and publications that may be relevant to your invention.\n\n**Step 2: Prepare a Patent Application**\n\nOnce you have determined that your invention is patentable, you can prepare a patent application. A patent application typically includes:\n\n1. A detailed description of your invention, including drawings and diagrams.\n2. A set of claims that define the scope of your invention.\n3. An abstract that summarizes your invention.\n\n**Step 3: File a Patent Application**\n\nYou can file your patent application with the USPTO. You can file online or by mail. The application fee for a utility patent is currently $65 for small entities and $1,600 for large entities.\n\n**Step 4: Wait for Patent Office Review**\n\nAfter filing your application, the USPTO will review your invention to determine whether it meets the requirements for a patent. This process can take several months to several years.\n\n**Step 5: Respond to Office Actions**\n\nIf the USPTO identifies any issues with your application, you will receive an office action. You will need to respond to the office action by addressing the issues raised and providing any additional information or amendments to your application.\n\n**Step 6: Receive a Patent**\n\nIf your application is approved, you will receive a patent. A patent is a legal right granted to the inventor that gives them the exclusive right to make, use, and sell their invention for a certain period of time.\n\n**Additional Steps**\n\nIn addition to the above steps, there are some additional steps you may need to take:\n\n1. **Request for Reexamination**: If you believe that a patent is invalid or that a new invention is substantially similar to an existing patent, you can request a reexamination of the patent.\n2. **Patent Reexamination**: If a reexamination is granted, the USPTO will review the patent to determine whether it is still valid.\n3. **Appeals**: If you disagree with a decision made by the USPTO, you can appeal the decision to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.\n\nIn conclusion, the steps to file a patent involve preparing a patent application, filing it with the USPTO, waiting for review, responding to office actions, and receiving a patent. Additionally, there are some additional steps you may need to take, such as requesting a reexamination or appealing a decision made by the USPTO."

This oath or declaration must contain statements that the application was made or authorized to be made by the affiant or declarant, and that the individual believes himself or herself to be the original inventor or an original joint inventor of a claimed invention in the application.\n\n2. **Additional Requirements**: The Director may specify additional information relating to the inventor and the invention that is required to be included in an oath or declaration.\n\n3. **Substitute Statement**: In lieu of executing an oath or declaration, the applicant for patent may provide a substitute statement under certain circumstances.\n\n4. **Secrecy of Certain Inventions**: The Commissioner of Patents may order that an invention be kept secret and withhold the publication of an application or the grant of a patent if the publication or disclosure of the invention might be detrimental to the national security.\n\n5. **Abandonment of Invention**: The invention disclosed in an application for patent subject to an order made pursuant to section 181 may be held abandoned if the invention has been published or disclosed or if an application for a patent therefor has been filed in a foreign country by the inventor, his successors, assigns, or legal representatives, or anyone in privity with him or them, without the consent of the Commissioner of Patents.\n\n6. **Prior Art**: When determining whether a patent or application for patent is prior art to a claimed invention, certain disclosures made 1 year or less before the effective filing date of the claimed invention shall not be prior art to the claimed invention under subsection (a)(1) if the disclosure was made by the inventor or joint inventor or by another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.\n\n7. **Common Ownership**: Subject matter disclosed and a claimed invention shall be deemed to have been owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person in applying the provisions of subsection (b)(2)(C) if the subject matter disclosed was developed and the claimed invention was made by, or on behalf of, 1 or more parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.\n\n8. **Patents and Published Applications Effective as Prior Art**: For purposes of determining whether a patent or application for patent is prior art to a claimed invention under subsection (a)(2), such patent or application shall be considered to have been effectively filed, with respect to any subject matter described in the patent or application.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can ensure a smoother and more successful patent filing process."
